              "instructions": "1. Partner A goes into a top of push up position.\n2. Partner B takes the ankles of partner A and lifts until partner A's body is horizontal.\n3. Partner B will squeeze one ankle and then let's go fo the ankle.\n4. Partner A needs to keep the released ankle next to the held ankle.\n5. If releasing ankles with a squeeze warning works well, partner B can release ankles without warning.\n6. If that works well, partner B can suddenly let go of an ankle and even try to fake out which ankle gets dropped.\n\nAcro Principle---\nAn acro principle is: \"The base balances. The flyer holds the shape.\"\n\nIt means that the base's job is to balance the flyer. And the flyer's job is to hold their shape. Holding the shape means that if the flyer is in hollow body position, the flyer holds that shape.\n\nThe reason is that if both the flyer and the base try to balance, an echo chamber of instability is created.\n\nThis exercises practices the flyer holding the shape.\n\nNote---\nThe goal of the exercise is to start gently and ramp up the challenge. It's not nice to overwhelm your partner. As partner B, you want to aim for letting your partner A have some success but also some challenges. The challenges should be so difficult that the foot drops but doesn't painfully hit the ground.",

              "instructions": "1. The base lies on their back with the knees up and lower leg about horizontal.\n2. The flyer places their hands a little below the knees. The exact position is that the middle of the base of the palms of the flyer are on the protuberance of the base's tibia (shin bone) - not on the knee cap.\n3. The base presents their dominant arm in a nice bone stack.\n4. The flyer places their knee on the presented hand.\n5. The flyer gently shifts as much weight as possible on the flyer's hands and the knee.\n6. The flyer places their knee on the other hand of the base.\n7. The flyer should be now on all fours. The base should be like on all fours but flipped on their back.\n8. The pair can now \"walk\", which means that they move opposite arms and knees forward and back.\n9. The next challenge is to move both arms and both legs in the same direction. (This will challenge the core.).\n10. The biggest challenge is to move arms and legs to the side away from each other.\n\nBone stacking---\nThis exercise introduces an important acro concept: bone stacking. A bone stack is if the wrist is directly over the elbow and the elbow directly of the shoulder. If the flyer places weight on such a bone stack, all the weight travels through the bone into the ground. To the base, finding the perfect bone stack should make the flyer feel \"weightless\". Any other alignment or bent elbows require muscle effort.\n\nThe same kind of stacking is also done with the legs: ankle over knee over hip.\n\nNote---\nWhen the flyer wants to place their knees on the base, it is common that a base wants to help by bending their arm. However, then the base is out of bone stack. Instead the base should present the arm in a proper bone stack. And the flyer's job is to reach the position with their knee.",

              "instructions": "1. The base lies on their back and places the arms down along the body.\n2. The flyer steps up so that the flyer's toes touch the base's finger tips.\n3. The flyer places the middle of the balls of the base's feet on the flyer's bump on the hip bone (ASIS - Anterior Superior Iliac Spine).\n4. The flyer leans a tiny little bit forward and then holds the body tight like a plank.\n5. The base bends their knees a little bit to allow the flyer to come forward and then pushes the flyer back to the starting position.\n6. The base repeats this, each time receiving the flyer deeper until the maximum depth is reached. (Some flexible bases can get their knees all the way to the ground!)\n\nImportant---\nA common tendency is that people want to push right away to go up to bird. However, I've found over and over that skipping over this exercises causes people to progress slower.\n\nUsually, they ran into a pose that they can't muscle. And then they are stuck hard because now they have to learn technique in a difficult pose.\n\nI recommend staying with this exercise. The flyer should have learned to allow the base to control the movement without any trying to help. (Trusting and letting go of control can be very hard for people. Learning this here, will make everything so much easier.) The base should have learned to control the flyer's movement with precision and control. (Target precise end positions for the movement. Learn to gently accelerate and decelerate.)\n\nTip---\nSome beginning bases struggle with hamstring flexibility. Rolling up a yoga mat and putting it under the sacrum can help.\n\nCommon Mistakes---\n- The flyer pushes their hips forward to follow the base's feet but leans back to keep their weight on their feet.\n- The flyer pulls back to help coming up.\n- The base let's the flyer drop forward to quickly and freaks out the flyer.\n- The base pushes the flyer too far at the end and causes the flyer to fall backwards.",

              "instructions": "1. Start in the lowest position from the previous bird receiving exercise.\n2. The base presents the palms in a nice bone stack with the finger tips pointing out.\n3. When the flyers hands naturally reach the base's hands without reaching, the flyer places the hands on top with the finger tips facing forward.\n4. As the base bent their knees, there should have been a point where it feels like the flyers weight has shifted over the base.\n5. When the point has passed, the base should try to scoop up the flyer with their heels and press the flyer into the air.\n6. The end position is that the flyer and base both have their arms and legs in vertical bone stacks. The flyer arches back (like upward dog in yoga) to accommodate the straight arms.\n\nCommon Problems---\n- The base has tight hamstrings. A pillow or rolled up mat under the sacrum can help short-term, but flexibility needs to be developed.\n- The flyer and/or base bent their elbows/knees and are out of stack. Feedback from the spotter helps.\n- The base doesn't know how to balance the flyer. Some bases are truly disoriented and don't realize that when the flyer drifts left, they have to push right. Some bases do not flatten their back against the ground. The rounded back doesn't allow them to ground in to the floor.\n\nSpotting---\nThe best choice for the beginning spotter is to stand next to the flyer's hips (center of gravity). The spotter should be in a goddess stance: feet wide and knees bent. This will allow them to have good body ergonomics to deal with the weight of the flyer and allows them to be close. One arm should be under the thighs of the flyer and the other arm under the belly. The spotter should not touch the flyer until needed to avoid disrupting the balance.\n\nA common mistake is that the spotter will be too far away or too gingerly to actually do anything in the moment of need.\n\nDeeper Cuts (Ways To Challenge Yourselves)---\n- Leg presses: The base bends and extends their arms and legs as low as possible.\n- Swivels: The base twists their feet left and right to make the flyer swivel left and right.\n- The base takes a foot away. (Flyers usually imagine that they have to lean or contort. However, they have to keep their shape very tight instead.)\n- Taking hands away: The base should press the ball's of their feet to the sky until the weight goes out of the hand connection. (Think stepping on the gas pedal of a car.)",

              "instructions": "1. The flyer steps with their feet next to the ears of the base and faces away.\n2. The base grabs the flyer's ankles.\n3. The base aims their feet for the flyer's 'thutt' (the area where the thighs and the butt meet).\n4. The flyer leans back to transfer weight on the the base's feet.\n5. The base straightens their legs and arms until they are in a nice bone stack.\n6. The base transfers their hands to hold the flyer's feet from the bottom in a C-grip (like a lego person).\n\nTips---\n- If the flexibility and size differences make it hard for the base to get their feet low enough under the butt of the flyer, there are two things to try. One, the flyer can grab the base's feet and push them down. Two, the flyer can step on the chest of the base.\n- The flyer doesn't lean back and thus the base can't lift the flyer.\n\nSpotting---\nThe spotter should be partially behind and to the side of the flyer. The goal is to have the spotter's body behind the flyer to block the flyer from falling backwards. At the same time, the spotter should see the face of the base because any grimaces can be a sign of trouble. The hand of the spotter should be hovering next to the thighs of the flyer.\n\nDeeper Cuts---The deeper cuts for the bird pose can also be done for the king throne pose.\n\nNote---\nThere are two very similar throne poses. When I learned it, one was called king throne (this one) and the other one straddle throne. Different groups use different names. Chair is also a commonly used name.",

              "instructions": "1. The flyer stands with their feet next to the base's ears, facing away.\n2. The base garbs the ankles of the flyer.\n3. The base aims their toes for roughly the bra strap or heart rate monitor height on the flyer's back.\n4. The flyer leans back.\n5. As the base receives the flyer, the base extends their arms.\n6. The end position should be roughly with the arms and legs leaning away from each other to equal parts. This is a counter balance, think of how some bridges are built with beams equally facing away from each other.\n7. The base should offer the flyer to adjust the stretch in the flyer's back by pushing more or less with the base's toes.\n\nSpotting---\nThe spotter should be in a goddess stance with their arms under the flyer's back and hamstrings.\n\nA Little Back Anatomy---\nThe back has a spine in the middle. The base should avoid the spine.\n\nThe upper part of the back is made up of the chest and ribs. That's a good place to put the base's feet. Lower on the back a soft area starts. Especially the area near the meeting point of the ribs and soft area should be avoided because that's where the kidneys are.\n\nSolar vs. Lunar Acroyoga---\nAcroyoga has two main branches. The solar branch is energetic and circus like. Those are the poses that we've been doing until now. The lunar branch is relaxing, healing, and restorative. These were poses where the flyers gets to relax instead of climb around. High-flying whale is one of such poses. It can feel very relaxing for the flyer to stay in the pose for a few minutes.\n\nDeeper Cuts---\n- In high-flying whale pose, the base can place the flyer's feet on the base's knees. Then the base can hold onto the top of the knees of the flyer. Now, the flyer can bend their knees to allow the flyer to 'fall back', but keep the flyer from actually falling with the hold onto the flyer's knees.\n\n- A fun way to exit is for the flyer to reach their arms back and the base to place the flyer's hands on the ground. This requires both enough back stretch from the flyer and enough flexibility from the base. From here, the flyer can go into a handstand and land on their feet.\n\nNote---\nIn case you are curious, there is such a thing as low-flying whale!",

The flyer places the foot of the bent leg onto the base's shin.\n6. The flyer and base repeat the process with the other side.\n7. The base bends the knees to allow the flyer's hips to lower below the flyer's shoulders.\n8. The flyer sits up in king throne.\n9. The base grips the flyer's feet with a C-grip (lego person grip.)\n10. The base takes a foot off.\n11. The base rotates the foot to be across the sacrum of the base.\n12. The base slowly lowers the leg with the flyer on. At the same time, the other leg glides up the back of the flyer. The flyer slowly leans back.\n12. The coordination of legs and flyer ends up in high-flying whale.\n13. The base rotates the foot on the back to be parallel to the spine again and places the other foot on the upper back of the flyer.\n14. Do everything backwards to end up in bird.\n\nCommunication---\nThe transitions of the flow require developing clear communication. Saying, 'move your left foot.' Is confusing because it's unclear if left is from the perspective of the base and flyer. Also, people can easily get confused and say 'left' but mean 'right.'\n\nA clear way to communicate is to announce what you want to do, e.g. 'keep your wait here' or 'lift this butt.' The verbal cue is followed by a hand squeeze.\n\nSpotting---\nSpotting is a carefully orchestrated dance. The spotter has to often move around. As a rule of thumb, spotting from behind the back is often a good idea. The back tends to be what's vulnerable to the flyer because people have arms and legs that can brace falls to the front. Also, being at the back, the spotter is out of the way of the flyer.\n\nTip---\nMost people rush a bit through learning the poses. They'll have minimally learned one pose and move on. Doing the transitions of the flow requires being able to take a foot way. If you are struggling with the flow, go back to each pose and practice what's in the section for 'deeper cuts.'\n\nParallel vs Perpendicular Foot---\nIn the description of the transition from throne to whale, the base should turn their foot perpendicular across the back. However, some teachers teach a foot parallel to the spine.\n\nHaving the foot across the back is nicer to the flyer. If the foot is only on one side of the spine, the flyer has to stabilize that.\n\nIt's good to start by being nice to your flyer. If you later find that your flyer doesn't need the help and you want to move faster, feel free to use a parallel foot.",

Start easy and then get more intense and unpredictable.\n3. Switch it up by pulling and pushing on the feet. Partner A should hold a strong ninety-degree angle at the hips, which should cause their hips and respectively torso to lift up.\n\nVariation:---\n- Start with partner A’s arms wide to have more leverage.\n- Progress to partner A’s arms alongside the body for more challenge.\n\nMotivation:---\nDevelops balance skills for basing.\n\nTips:---\n- HUG THE SHOULDERS TO THE GROUND: Most people have a bit of a rounded back. You may picture the round keel of a boat. As soon as it's put on dry land, it rolls on its side. Construction cranes on the other hand extend legs out of the side to have a wider base. Similarly, if the person on the ground focused on extending the outside edges of the shoulder blade to the ground, they will have a wider base.\n\n- YIELDING: Initially, the person on the ground is best served by keeping as rigid as possible. However, once the tossing partner generates overwhelming tosses, yielding just enough to keep the upper back \"glued\" to the ground is more helpful. In physics terms, the side that one is tossed towards becomes the fulcrum. The legs become the weight. The more counterweight one can generate leaning opposite to the legs helps. Leaving the opposite shoulder on the ground is more counterweight than allowing it to be lifted up.\n\nDeeper cuts:---\n- Alternate light and strong tosses: This trains the partner on the ground sensitivity.\n- Vary the speed of the toss: For example, start lightly tossing and finish with a fling.\n\nCommon mistake:---\nWhen pulling on the lying partner’s legs, the torso should lift up. However, often the partner allows the ninety-degree angle at the hips to collapse and then lifts up their head to pretend to do the shape. Remind them to tighten the angle at their hips.",

              "synopsis": "Develops balance skills for transitions",
              "instructions": "1. Start in bird pose.\n2. The base presses the ball’s of their feet up (like accelerating in a car) until there is no more weight in the hands. Then the flyer can release the hands. Reconnect hands.\n3. The base removes one foot.\n4. The base bends and straightens their legs like a push-up but with their legs - a leg up.\n5. The base pivots the flyer left and right.\n\nMotivation:---\nDevelop range of motion for the base to move the flyer into and out of different positions. The more the base can support the flyer away from a perfect bone stack, the easier the next lessons will become.\n\nCommunication:---\nRemember to communicate with hand squeezes which leg keeps the weight and which leg moves. Words like left and right are confusing because it’s unclear who’s left it is. Make sure to say what the squeeze means.\n\nTips:---\n- Bases often drop the flyer when they remove one leg. The flyer tends to fall towards the side of the remaining leg. The physical effect is similar to stepping up onto the side of a sailboat. That side will dip down because the side is away from the center of gravity. To correct that, the base has to move their leg to the center of their body. Learning to receive the flyer’s weight by centering the base leg over their own body is a critical skill for the rest of this level.\n\nSpotting:---\nThe spotter should stand on the side with one arm under the belly and one arm under the thighs of the flyer. The spotter should maintain eye contact with the base’s face. The base making a face is often a warning signal that a crash is imminent.",

              "title": "Position lesson 1: Shoulderstand",
              "synopsis": "Enter the exciting world of inversions",
              "instructions": "1. The base lies on their back with the knees bent.\n2. The flyer stands over the base’s belly facing the base’s head.\n3. The flyer bends forward and reaches between their legs to place their hands on the middle of the base’s thighs in a C-grip (Lego person grip).\n4. The base places their hands on the flyer’s shoulders. (See discussion below.)\n5. The flyer steps onto the base’s knees.\n6. The flyer lifts one leg up and as far over towards the base’s head as possible.\n7. The flyer might have to make a hop to reach shoulderstand.\n\nTips:---\n- HAND POSITION ON SHOULDERS: Most bases have the inclination to put their hands _under_ the flyer’s shoulder. That’s bad. It creates pressure on their own wrist and doesn’t support the flyer in the best way. The base’s hands should rather be on the back of the shoulder plates. The cue is to think of the hands more as suction cups molding to the shoulder blade.\n\n- BASES SHOULD MAINTAIN PRESSURE TOWARDS THEIR THIGHS: The flyer’s and base’s arm create a triangle over the ground. Flyers can push the base’s hands back, which in turn causes the flyer’s hands to lift off the base’s thighs. When that happens the triangle is broken and the pose crashes. Thus, the base should maintain a constant downward pressure towards their thighs to keep this from happening. (And flyers should be conscious that their goal is to go up, not forward!)\n\n- FLYER’S STAGGING LEGS: Some flyers have a hard time getting their hips over their shoulders. Staging the legs tends to solve that. Staging means that while one foot of the flyer remains on the base’s knee, the other flyer foot reaches over as far as possible to create a counterweight.\n\nEntry from bird:---\nOnce this is working well, it’s time to attempt entering shoulder stand from bird.\n\n1. The pair starts in bird.\n2. The flyer holds the base’s ankles in C-grip.\n3. The base tilts their toes down to tilt the flyer's shoulders towards the base's hands.\n4. Once the flyer’s shoulders are on the base’s hands, the flyer can push their hips of the base’s feet to enter shoulder stand.\n\nCommon mistake:---\nSome flyer struggle to get their hips of the feet of the base. A simple exercise teaches them what they need to do: The flyers stands and hold their straight arms down at a 45-degree angle. A partner puts their hands on top of the flyer’s hand. The flyer is asked to push their straight arms up as hard as they can. That’s the same motion that they need to do to lift their hips off.\n\nSpotting:---\nThe spotter should have their hands on both sides of the flyer’s hips. The main risk is that the flyer falls towards their back. The spotter should push the hips back so that the flyer lands on the base’s feet in case of going over.\n\nDeeper cuts:---\n- FLYER RANGE OF MOTION: Once the flyer is in shoulder stand, they can move their legs through different positions to develop range of motion for both the flyer and the base: Legs straight up, front split, side split, tucked.\n\n- SLOW DESCEND: An excellent exercise is for the flyer to very slowly descend from shoulder stand back to the ground. The slowing down is achieved by a counterbalance. As the flyer’s feet move towards the ground, their weight should be counteracted by pushing the hips further back. This skill can be built to the point where the flyer barely hovers over the ground and can push back up into shoulderstand without touching down.",

              "synopsis": "A new kind of challenge",
              "instructions": "1. The pair starts in bird.\n2. The base removes one foot.\n3. The flyer brings the free knee to their chest (like going to throne).\n4. The base places their free foot on the shin of the flyer’s free shin. (See foot position description below)\n5. The flyer shifts onto the shin and repeats with the other leg.\n6. At first, the flyer stays in child’s pose on the base’s feet. (Let things stabilize before moving on.)\n7. When comfortable, the flyer can go to a _high_ kneeling pose. (Important: When sitting up, shift the hips forward. If only sitting up low, the flyer will fall off the base’s feet!)\n8. When ready to come down, go back to child’s pose.\n9. Connect hands.\n10. The base moves the flyer towards their feet while the flyer extends their knees to stand up.\n\nBase’s foot position:---\nThe shin bone (tibia) has a bump (protrusion) near the knee. The middle of the ball’s of the feet of the flyer should be on the bump.\n\nBe close to the flyer’s knee but void the knee itself.\n\nFor the base’s heel placement, find a post that is comfortable to the flyer. Some flyer’s feel pain when the base’s heel goes across their shinbone.\n\nHow to develop comfort and stability:---\nSome students dislike standing on the base. It feels unstable and shaky. Here is the reason of why it feels shaky and how to overcome it.\n\nMost people can stand on the ground just fine and are very comfortable. Why does it get so shaky when standing on top of a partner? Well, when we get scared, we tense up and react to every little thing out of proportion. Recall walking on slick ice. Now if the flyer does a quick reaction, it freaks out the base. So the base does a quick reaction. That freaks out the flyer. The result is an echo chamber of jitters.\n\nThe solution that the nervous systems have to get used to that things are actually very stable. And if the partner does a small twitch, they don’t have to react with a panic twitch. Doing that is pretty simple. Simply have the flyer hang out in child’s pose for a minute or longer. The nervous systems will calm down. Everything will become more stable. Having the flyer dance with the arms in the air is another good exercise. The flyer will be distracted from being tight and scared in order to discover that there is a lot more safe range of motion possible than they thought.\n\nSpotting:---\nThe spotter should start by having one hand in C-grip near the flyer’s bicep. This can catch the flyer falling forward. The spotter’s other arm should be around the flyer’s hip. As the flyer comes up on their knees, the spotter transitions to having both arms around the hip.\n\nTips:---\n- The flyer should pull their knees slightly together because there is a tendency for the flyer to push the base’s legs apart.\n- The base’s perfect stack is NOT with the legs straight up. The base’s legs should aim towards the hips of the flyer. The base’s legs and the flyer’s thighs should make a straight line. Because the flyer is often larger than the flyer, that line is angled in a bit.",

              "instructions": "1. The pair starts in king throne.\n2. The flyer places their feet on the base’s shin. (The same foot placement as shin-to-foot only on the base.)\n3. The flyer slowly stands up while the base moves their feet down so that the base can provide a horizontal shelf with their shins.\n4. Coming out of it is doing the steps in reverse.\n\nCommon problem:---\nThe process of coming out of the pose requires that the flyer sit down while the base straightens their legs. The flyers are often to reluctant to sit down too far without feeling the base’s feet. Yet because raising the base’s feet also raises the angle of the shins that they are standing on, they risk slipping off. Finding the point of the flyer reaching the point where they sit low enough without slipping off can be scary for the flyer. The flyer will likely need some reassurance of how far away the base’s feet are: \"3 inches, 2 inches, 1 inch, almost there!\"\n\nDirect entry:---\nOnce entering from throne works well, we want to enter foot-to-shin directly from standing. The skill to balance this pose on one foot will be critical for the integration flow.\n\n1. The base lies on their back with their knees tugged onto the chest and their shins as horizontal as possible.\n2. The flyer stands next to the hip of the base.\n3. The flyer places the inside foot onto the opposite shin of the base.\n4. The flyer pours weight into the foot very gradually. (Going too fast will cause the base to roll to the side. The base has to hug the leg towards the center line.)\n5. Once the flyer has all their weight on the base, they drag their free foot up along the base’s side. (The dragging adds stability.)\n6. The flyer can place the second foot on the base’s shin.\n7. When the pair is comfortable, the base can slowly move their knees above their hips.\n8. Exit by doing the steps backwards.\n\nSpotting:---\nThe spotter should stand on the side of the flyer and put their straight arms in front of and behind the flyer. The spotter should bear hug the flyer in case of a fall.\n\nSafety Tip:---\nThis pose can come down very quickly. The spotter should be very prepared to grab the flyer quickly without notice.\n\nThe biggest danger is that if the flyer’s foot slips to the inside. If the flyer’s foot slips straight down, the flyer usually lands on their feet. However, if the foot slips towards the inside, the legs can fly very quickly to the side and rotate the flyer to come down on their side. Take your time to slowly graduate this. There is no shame in spending time to slowly pour the weight onto the base and to simply repeat that without actually going up.",

              "instructions": "1. Start in bird. (See the previous level)\n2. Go to shoulder stand. (See the earlier lesson)\n3. The flyer bends their knees and brings their knees towards the base’s feet.\n4. The flyer transfers their hands to the base’s wrists.\n5. If the base can lower their feet enough, the flyer can now sit up in shin-to-foot.\n6. The flyer may help by wiggling their hands onto the base’s palms. Then the flyer can push their chest over their own knees.\n7. Once in shin-to-foot, the flyer transfers all weight to one leg.\n8. The flyer brings the free foot to the base’s shin.\n9. The flyer does the same with the other leg and is now in foot-to-shin.\n10. Use any exit from here, e.g. go to king throne.\n\nTips:---\n- Getting the hips over the legs to enter shin-to-foot can be difficult. Wide legs (flyer and base) can help lower the flyer’s hips more.\n\n- A lot of the transitions require balance. People expecting to succeed on the first try and right away set themselves up for frustration. Take your time to develop balance. Spend time simply hanging out to allow the wobbles to work themselves out. Use hands and gliding along the partner’s body for added stability.\n\nSpotting:---\nSpotting is often a dance. Spotting this flow requires moving to different spotting positions. When the flyer is leaning forward, have a C-grip in front of their bicep to catch them from falling forward. When they are standing, put the flyer into a \"cage\" between your outreached arms to catch them with a bear hug if needed. Most other times, having the spotters’ hands next to the flyer’s hips is the most effective.\n\nGenerally maintain a position where you can see the base’s face for early warning about impending trouble. Try to stay towards the flyer’s back to be out of their way.",

In this case, we are doing small, chest-focused body waves on 1 count.\n\nQuick turns:---\nIn contrast to the four-step turn from earlier, this is a quick turn.
