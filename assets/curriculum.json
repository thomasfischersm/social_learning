              "instructions": "1. Partner A goes into a top of push up position.\n2. Partner B takes the ankles of partner A and lifts until partner A's body is horizontal.\n3. Partner B will squeeze one ankle and then let's go fo the ankle.\n4. Partner A needs to keep the released ankle next to the held ankle.\n5. If releasing ankles with a squeeze warning works well, partner B can release ankles without warning.\n6. If that works well, partner B can suddenly let go of an ankle and even try to fake out which ankle gets dropped.\n\nAcro Principle---\nAn acro principle is: \"The base balances. The flyer holds the shape.\"\n\nIt means that the base's job is to balance the flyer. And the flyer's job is to hold their shape. Holding the shape means that if the flyer is in hollow body position, the flyer holds that shape.\n\nThe reason is that if both the flyer and the base try to balance, an echo chamber of instability is created.\n\nThis exercises practices the flyer holding the shape.\n\nNote---\nThe goal of the exercise is to start gently and ramp up the challenge. It's not nice to overwhelm your partner. As partner B, you want to aim for letting your partner A have some success but also some challenges. The challenges should be so difficult that the foot drops but doesn't painfully hit the ground.",

              "instructions": "1. The base lies on their back with the knees up and lower leg about horizontal.\n2. The flyer places their hands a little below the knees. The exact position is that the middle of the base of the palms of the flyer are on the protuberance of the base's tibia (shin bone) - not on the knee cap.\n3. The base presents their dominant arm in a nice bone stack.\n4. The flyer places their knee on the presented hand.\n5. The flyer gently shifts as much weight as possible on the flyer's hands and the knee.\n6. The flyer places their knee on the other hand of the base.\n7. The flyer should be now on all fours. The base should be like on all fours but flipped on their back.\n8. The pair can now \"walk\", which means that they move opposite arms and knees forward and back.\n9. The next challenge is to move both arms and both legs in the same direction. (This will challenge the core.).\n10. The biggest challenge is to move arms and legs to the side away from each other.\n\nBone stacking---\nThis exercise introduces an important acro concept: bone stacking. A bone stack is if the wrist is directly over the elbow and the elbow directly of the shoulder. If the flyer places weight on such a bone stack, all the weight travels through the bone into the ground. To the base, finding the perfect bone stack should make the flyer feel \"weightless\". Any other alignment or bent elbows require muscle effort.\n\nThe same kind of stacking is also done with the legs: ankle over knee over hip.\n\nNote---\nWhen the flyer wants to place their knees on the base, it is common that a base wants to help by bending their arm. However, then the base is out of bone stack. Instead the base should present the arm in a proper bone stack. And the flyer's job is to reach the position with their knee.",

              "instructions": "1. The base lies on their back and places the arms down along the body.\n2. The flyer steps up so that the flyer's toes touch the base's finger tips.\n3. The flyer places the middle of the balls of the base's feet on the flyer's bump on the hip bone (ASIS - Anterior Superior Iliac Spine).\n4. The flyer leans a tiny little bit forward and then holds the body tight like a plank.\n5. The base bends their knees a little bit to allow the flyer to come forward and then pushes the flyer back to the starting position.\n6. The base repeats this, each time receiving the flyer deeper until the maximum depth is reached. (Some flexible bases can get their knees all the way to the ground!)\n\nImportant---\nA common tendency is that people want to push right away to go up to bird. However, I've found over and over that skipping over this exercises causes people to progress slower.\n\nUsually, they ran into a pose that they can't muscle. And then they are stuck hard because now they have to learn technique in a difficult pose.\n\nI recommend staying with this exercise. The flyer should have learned to allow the base to control the movement without any trying to help. (Trusting and letting go of control can be very hard for people. Learning this here, will make everything so much easier.) The base should have learned to control the flyer's movement with precision and control. (Target precise end positions for the movement. Learn to gently accelerate and decelerate.)\n\nTip---\nSome beginning bases struggle with hamstring flexibility. Rolling up a yoga mat and putting it under the sacrum can help.\n\nCommon Mistakes---\n- The flyer pushes their hips forward to follow the base's feet but leans back to keep their weight on their feet.\n- The flyer pulls back to help coming up.\n- The base let's the flyer drop forward to quickly and freaks out the flyer.\n- The base pushes the flyer too far at the end and causes the flyer to fall backwards.",

              "instructions": "1. Start in the lowest position from the previous bird receiving exercise.\n2. The base presents the palms in a nice bone stack with the finger tips pointing out.\n3. When the flyers hands naturally reach the base's hands without reaching, the flyer places the hands on top with the finger tips facing forward.\n4. As the base bent their knees, there should have been a point where it feels like the flyers weight has shifted over the base.\n5. When the point has passed, the base should try to scoop up the flyer with their heels and press the flyer into the air.\n6. The end position is that the flyer and base both have their arms and legs in vertical bone stacks. The flyer arches back (like upward dog in yoga) to accommodate the straight arms.\n\nCommon Problems---\n- The base has tight hamstrings. A pillow or rolled up mat under the sacrum can help short-term, but flexibility needs to be developed.\n- The flyer and/or base bent their elbows/knees and are out of stack. Feedback from the spotter helps.\n- The base doesn't know how to balance the flyer. Some bases are truly disoriented and don't realize that when the flyer drifts left, they have to push right. Some bases do not flatten their back against the ground. The rounded back doesn't allow them to ground in to the floor.\n\nSpotting---\nThe best choice for the beginning spotter is to stand next to the flyer's hips (center of gravity). The spotter should be in a goddess stance: feet wide and knees bent. This will allow them to have good body ergonomics to deal with the weight of the flyer and allows them to be close. One arm should be under the thighs of the flyer and the other arm under the belly. The spotter should not touch the flyer until needed to avoid disrupting the balance.\n\nA common mistake is that the spotter will be too far away or too gingerly to actually do anything in the moment of need.\n\nDeeper Cuts (Ways To Challenge Yourselves)---\n- Leg presses: The base bends and extends their arms and legs as low as possible.\n- Swivels: The base twists their feet left and right to make the flyer swivel left and right.\n- The base takes a foot away. (Flyers usually imagine that they have to lean or contort. However, they have to keep their shape very tight instead.)\n- Taking hands away: The base should press the ball's of their feet to the sky until the weight goes out of the hand connection. (Think stepping on the gas pedal of a car.)",

              "instructions": "1. The flyer steps with their feet next to the ears of the base and faces away.\n2. The base grabs the flyer's ankles.\n3. The base aims their feet for the flyer's 'thutt' (the area where the thighs and the butt meet).\n4. The flyer leans back to transfer weight on the the base's feet.\n5. The base straightens their legs and arms until they are in a nice bone stack.\n6. The base transfers their hands to hold the flyer's feet from the bottom in a C-grip (like a lego person).\n\nTips---\n- If the flexibility and size differences make it hard for the base to get their feet low enough under the butt of the flyer, there are two things to try. One, the flyer can grab the base's feet and push them down. Two, the flyer can step on the chest of the base.\n- The flyer doesn't lean back and thus the base can't lift the flyer.\n\nSpotting---\nThe spotter should be partially behind and to the side of the flyer. The goal is to have the spotter's body behind the flyer to block the flyer from falling backwards. At the same time, the spotter should see the face of the base because any grimaces can be a sign of trouble. The hand of the spotter should be hovering next to the thighs of the flyer.\n\nDeeper Cuts---The deeper cuts for the bird pose can also be done for the king throne pose.\n\nNote---\nThere are two very similar throne poses. When I learned it, one was called king throne (this one) and the other one straddle throne. Different groups use different names. Chair is also a commonly used name.",

              "instructions": "1. The flyer stands with their feet next to the base's ears, facing away.\n2. The base garbs the ankles of the flyer.\n3. The base aims their toes for roughly the bra strap or heart rate monitor height on the flyer's back.\n4. The flyer leans back.\n5. As the base receives the flyer, the base extends their arms.\n6. The end position should be roughly with the arms and legs leaning away from each other to equal parts. This is a counter balance, think of how some bridges are built with beams equally facing away from each other.\n7. The base should offer the flyer to adjust the stretch in the flyer's back by pushing more or less with the base's toes.\n\nSpotting---\nThe spotter should be in a goddess stance with their arms under the flyer's back and hamstrings.\n\nA Little Back Anatomy---\nThe back has a spine in the middle. The base should avoid the spine.\n\nThe upper part of the back is made up of the chest and ribs. That's a good place to put the base's feet. Lower on the back a soft area starts. Especially the area near the meeting point of the ribs and soft area should be avoided because that's where the kidneys are.\n\nSolar vs. Lunar Acroyoga---\nAcroyoga has two main branches. The solar branch is energetic and circus like. Those are the poses that we've been doing until now. The lunar branch is relaxing, healing, and restorative. These were poses where the flyers gets to relax instead of climb around. High-flying whale is one of such poses. It can feel very relaxing for the flyer to stay in the pose for a few minutes.\n\nDeeper Cuts---\n- In high-flying whale pose, the base can place the flyer's feet on the base's knees. Then the base can hold onto the top of the knees of the flyer. Now, the flyer can bend their knees to allow the flyer to 'fall back', but keep the flyer from actually falling with the hold onto the flyer's knees.\n\n- A fun way to exit is for the flyer to reach their arms back and the base to place the flyer's hands on the ground. This requires both enough back stretch from the flyer and enough flexibility from the base. From here, the flyer can go into a handstand and land on their feet.\n\nNote---\nIn case you are curious, there is such a thing as low-flying whale!",

The flyer places the foot of the bent leg onto the base's shin.\n6. The flyer and base repeat the process with the other side.\n7. The base bends the knees to allow the flyer's hips to lower below the flyer's shoulders.\n8. The flyer sits up in king throne.\n9. The base grips the flyer's feet with a C-grip (lego person grip.)\n10. The base takes a foot off.\n11. The base rotates the foot to be across the sacrum of the base.\n12. The base slowly lowers the leg with the flyer on. At the same time, the other leg glides up the back of the flyer. The flyer slowly leans back.\n12. The coordination of legs and flyer ends up in high-flying whale.\n13. The base rotates the foot on the back to be parallel to the spine again and places the other foot on the upper back of the flyer.\n14. Do everything backwards to end up in bird.\n\nCommunication---\nThe transitions of the flow require developing clear communication. Saying, 'move your left foot.' Is confusing because it's unclear if left is from the perspective of the base and flyer. Also, people can easily get confused and say 'left' but mean 'right.'\n\nA clear way to communicate is to announce what you want to do, e.g. 'keep your wait here' or 'lift this butt.' The verbal cue is followed by a hand squeeze.\n\nSpotting---\nSpotting is a carefully orchestrated dance. The spotter has to often move around. As a rule of thumb, spotting from behind the back is often a good idea. The back tends to be what's vulnerable to the flyer because people have arms and legs that can brace falls to the front. Also, being at the back, the spotter is out of the way of the flyer.\n\nTip---\nMost people rush a bit through learning the poses. They'll have minimally learned one pose and move on. Doing the transitions of the flow requires being able to take a foot way. If you are struggling with the flow, go back to each pose and practice what's in the section for 'deeper cuts.'\n\nParallel vs Perpendicular Foot---\nIn the description of the transition from throne to whale, the base should turn their foot perpendicular across the back. However, some teachers teach a foot parallel to the spine.\n\nHaving the foot across the back is nicer to the flyer. If the foot is only on one side of the spine, the flyer has to stabilize that.\n\nIt's good to start by being nice to your flyer. If you later find that your flyer doesn't need the help and you want to move faster, feel free to use a parallel foot.",

Start easy and then get more intense and unpredictable.\n3. Switch it up by pulling and pushing on the feet. Partner A should hold a strong ninety-degree angle at the hips, which should cause their hips and respectively torso to lift up.\n\nVariation:---\n- Start with partner A’s arms wide to have more leverage.\n- Progress to partner A’s arms alongside the body for more challenge.\n\nMotivation:---\nDevelops balance skills for basing.\n\nTips:---\n- HUG THE SHOULDERS TO THE GROUND: Most people have a bit of a rounded back. You may picture the round keel of a boat. As soon as it's put on dry land, it rolls on its side. Construction cranes on the other hand extend legs out of the side to have a wider base. Similarly, if the person on the ground focused on extending the outside edges of the shoulder blade to the ground, they will have a wider base.\n\n- YIELDING: Initially, the person on the ground is best served by keeping as rigid as possible. However, once the tossing partner generates overwhelming tosses, yielding just enough to keep the upper back \"glued\" to the ground is more helpful. In physics terms, the side that one is tossed towards becomes the fulcrum. The legs become the weight. The more counterweight one can generate leaning opposite to the legs helps. Leaving the opposite shoulder on the ground is more counterweight than allowing it to be lifted up.\n\nDeeper cuts:---\n- Alternate light and strong tosses: This trains the partner on the ground sensitivity.\n- Vary the speed of the toss: For example, start lightly tossing and finish with a fling.\n\nCommon mistake:---\nWhen pulling on the lying partner’s legs, the torso should lift up. However, often the partner allows the ninety-degree angle at the hips to collapse and then lifts up their head to pretend to do the shape. Remind them to tighten the angle at their hips.",

              "instructions": "1. Start in bird pose.\n2. The base presses the ball’s of their feet up (like accelerating in a car) until there is no more weight in the hands. Then the flyer can release the hands. Reconnect hands.\n3. The base removes one foot.\n4. The base bends and straightens their legs like a push-up but with their legs - a leg up.\n5. The base pivots the flyer left and right.\n\nMotivation:---\nDevelop range of motion for the base to move the flyer into and out of different positions. The more the base can support the flyer away from a perfect bone stack, the easier the next lessons will become.\n\nCommunication:---\nRemember to communicate with hand squeezes which leg keeps the weight and which leg moves. Words like left and right are confusing because it’s unclear who’s left it is. Make sure to say what the squeeze means.\n\nTips:---\n- Bases often drop the flyer when they remove one leg. The flyer tends to fall towards the side of the remaining leg. The physical effect is similar to stepping up onto the side of a sailboat. That side will dip down because the side is away from the center of gravity. To correct that, the base has to move their leg to the center of their body. Learning to receive the flyer’s weight by centering the base leg over their own body is a critical skill for the rest of this level.\n\nSpotting:---\nThe spotter should stand on the side with one arm under the belly and one arm under the thighs of the flyer. The spotter should maintain eye contact with the base’s face. The base making a face is often a warning signal that a crash is imminent.",

              "synopsis": "Enter the exciting world of inversions",
              "instructions": "1. The base lies on their back with the knees bent.\n2. The flyer stands over the base’s belly facing the base’s head.\n3. The flyer bends forward and reaches between their legs to place their hands on the middle of the base’s thighs in a C-grip (Lego person grip).\n4. The base places their hands on the flyer’s shoulders. (See discussion below.)\n5. The flyer steps onto the base’s knees.\n6. The flyer lifts one leg up and as far over towards the base’s head as possible.\n7. The flyer might have to make a hop to reach shoulderstand.\n\nTips:---\n- HAND POSITION ON SHOULDERS: Most bases have the inclination to put their hands _under_ the flyer’s shoulder. That’s bad. It creates pressure on their own wrist and doesn’t support the flyer in the best way. The base’s hands should rather be on the back of the shoulder plates. The cue is to think of the hands more as suction cups molding to the shoulder blade.\n\n- BASES SHOULD MAINTAIN PRESSURE TOWARDS THEIR THIGHS: The flyer’s and base’s arm create a triangle over the ground. Flyers can push the base’s hands back, which in turn causes the flyer’s hands to lift off the base’s thighs. When that happens the triangle is broken and the pose crashes. Thus, the base should maintain a constant downward pressure towards their thighs to keep this from happening. (And flyers should be conscious that their goal is to go up, not forward!)\n\n- FLYER’S STAGGING LEGS: Some flyers have a hard time getting their hips over their shoulders. Staging the legs tends to solve that. Staging means that while one foot of the flyer remains on the base’s knee, the other flyer foot reaches over as far as possible to create a counterweight.\n\nEntry from bird:---\nOnce this is working well, it’s time to attempt entering shoulder stand from bird.\n\n1. The pair starts in bird.\n2. The flyer holds the base’s ankles in C-grip.\n3. The base tilts their toes down to tilt the flyer's shoulders towards the base's hands.\n4. Once the flyer’s shoulders are on the base’s hands, the flyer can push their hips of the base’s feet to enter shoulder stand.\n\nCommon mistake:---\nSome flyer struggle to get their hips of the feet of the base. A simple exercise teaches them what they need to do: The flyers stands and hold their straight arms down at a 45-degree angle. A partner puts their hands on top of the flyer’s hand. The flyer is asked to push their straight arms up as hard as they can. That’s the same motion that they need to do to lift their hips off.\n\nSpotting:---\nThe spotter should have their hands on both sides of the flyer’s hips. The main risk is that the flyer falls towards their back. The spotter should push the hips back so that the flyer lands on the base’s feet in case of going over.\n\nDeeper cuts:---\n- FLYER RANGE OF MOTION: Once the flyer is in shoulder stand, they can move their legs through different positions to develop range of motion for both the flyer and the base: Legs straight up, front split, side split, tucked.\n\n- SLOW DESCEND: An excellent exercise is for the flyer to very slowly descend from shoulder stand back to the ground. The slowing down is achieved by a counterbalance. As the flyer’s feet move towards the ground, their weight should be counteracted by pushing the hips further back. This skill can be built to the point where the flyer barely hovers over the ground and can push back up into shoulderstand without touching down.",

              "synopsis": "A new kind of challenge",
              "instructions": "1. The pair starts in bird.\n2. The base removes one foot.\n3. The flyer brings the free knee to their chest (like going to throne).\n4. The base places their free foot on the shin of the flyer’s free shin. (See foot position description below)\n5. The flyer shifts onto the shin and repeats with the other leg.\n6. At first, the flyer stays in child’s pose on the base’s feet. (Let things stabilize before moving on.)\n7. When comfortable, the flyer can go to a _high_ kneeling pose. (Important: When sitting up, shift the hips forward. If only sitting up low, the flyer will fall off the base’s feet!)\n8. When ready to come down, go back to child’s pose.\n9. Connect hands.\n10. The base moves the flyer towards their feet while the flyer extends their knees to stand up.\n\nBase’s foot position:---\nThe shin bone (tibia) has a bump (protrusion) near the knee. The middle of the ball’s of the feet of the flyer should be on the bump.\n\nBe close to the flyer’s knee but void the knee itself.\n\nFor the base’s heel placement, find a post that is comfortable to the flyer. Some flyer’s feel pain when the base’s heel goes across their shinbone.\n\nHow to develop comfort and stability:---\nSome students dislike standing on the base. It feels unstable and shaky. Here is the reason of why it feels shaky and how to overcome it.\n\nMost people can stand on the ground just fine and are very comfortable. Why does it get so shaky when standing on top of a partner? Well, when we get scared, we tense up and react to every little thing out of proportion. Recall walking on slick ice. Now if the flyer does a quick reaction, it freaks out the base. So the base does a quick reaction. That freaks out the flyer. The result is an echo chamber of jitters.\n\nThe solution that the nervous systems have to get used to that things are actually very stable. And if the partner does a small twitch, they don’t have to react with a panic twitch. Doing that is pretty simple. Simply have the flyer hang out in child’s pose for a minute or longer. The nervous systems will calm down. Everything will become more stable. Having the flyer dance with the arms in the air is another good exercise. The flyer will be distracted from being tight and scared in order to discover that there is a lot more safe range of motion possible than they thought.\n\nSpotting:---\nThe spotter should start by having one hand in C-grip near the flyer’s bicep. This can catch the flyer falling forward. The spotter’s other arm should be around the flyer’s hip. As the flyer comes up on their knees, the spotter transitions to having both arms around the hip.\n\nTips:---\n- The flyer should pull their knees slightly together because there is a tendency for the flyer to push the base’s legs apart.\n- The base’s perfect stack is NOT with the legs straight up. The base’s legs should aim towards the hips of the flyer. The base’s legs and the flyer’s thighs should make a straight line. Because the flyer is often larger than the flyer, that line is angled in a bit.",

The flyer slowly stands up while the base moves their feet down so that the base can provide a horizontal shelf with their shins.\n4. Coming out of it is doing the steps in reverse.\n\nCommon problem:---\nThe process of coming out of the pose requires that the flyer sit down while the base straightens their legs. The flyers are often to reluctant to sit down too far without feeling the base’s feet. Yet because raising the base’s feet also raises the angle of the shins that they are standing on, they risk slipping off. Finding the point of the flyer reaching the point where they sit low enough without slipping off can be scary for the flyer. The flyer will likely need some reassurance of how far away the base’s feet are: \"3 inches, 2 inches, 1 inch, almost there!\"\n\nDirect entry:---\nOnce entering from throne works well, we want to enter foot-to-shin directly from standing. The skill to balance this pose on one foot will be critical for the integration flow.\n\n1. The base lies on their back with their knees tugged onto the chest and their shins as horizontal as possible.\n2. The flyer stands next to the hip of the base.\n3. The flyer places the inside foot onto the opposite shin of the base.\n4. The flyer pours weight into the foot very gradually. (Going too fast will cause the base to roll to the side. The base has to hug the leg towards the center line.)\n5. Once the flyer has all their weight on the base, they drag their free foot up along the base’s side. (The dragging adds stability.)\n6. The flyer can place the second foot on the base’s shin.\n7. When the pair is comfortable, the base can slowly move their knees above their hips.\n8. Exit by doing the steps backwards.\n\nSpotting:---\nThe spotter should stand on the side of the flyer and put their straight arms in front of and behind the flyer. The spotter should bear hug the flyer in case of a fall.\n\nSafety Tip:---\nThis pose can come down very quickly. The spotter should be very prepared to grab the flyer quickly without notice.\n\nThe biggest danger is that if the flyer’s foot slips to the inside. If the flyer’s foot slips straight down, the flyer usually lands on their feet. However, if the foot slips towards the inside, the legs can fly very quickly to the side and rotate the flyer to come down on their side. Take your time to slowly graduate this. There is no shame in spending time to slowly pour the weight onto the base and to simply repeat that without actually going up.",

              "instructions": "1. Start in bird. (See the previous level)\n2. Go to shoulder stand. (See the earlier lesson)\n3. The flyer bends their knees and brings their knees towards the base’s feet.\n4. The flyer transfers their hands to the base’s wrists.\n5. If the base can lower their feet enough, the flyer can now sit up in shin-to-foot.\n6. The flyer may help by wiggling their hands onto the base’s palms. Then the flyer can push their chest over their own knees.\n7. Once in shin-to-foot, the flyer transfers all weight to one leg.\n8. The flyer brings the free foot to the base’s shin.\n9. The flyer does the same with the other leg and is now in foot-to-shin.\n10. Use any exit from here, e.g. go to king throne.\n\nTips:---\n- Getting the hips over the legs to enter shin-to-foot can be difficult. Wide legs (flyer and base) can help lower the flyer’s hips more.\n\n- A lot of the transitions require balance. People expecting to succeed on the first try and right away set themselves up for frustration. Take your time to develop balance. Spend time simply hanging out to allow the wobbles to work themselves out. Use hands and gliding along the partner’s body for added stability.\n\nSpotting:---\nSpotting is often a dance. Spotting this flow requires moving to different spotting positions. When the flyer is leaning forward, have a C-grip in front of their bicep to catch them from falling forward. When they are standing, put the flyer into a \"cage\" between your outreached arms to catch them with a bear hug if needed. Most other times, having the spotters’ hands next to the flyer’s hips is the most effective.\n\nGenerally maintain a position where you can see the base’s face for early warning about impending trouble. Try to stay towards the flyer’s back to be out of their way.",

              "instructions": "1. The base and flyer stand side-by-side.\n2. The base places the right foot inside of the right foot of the flyer (directly touching).\n3. (There are variously elegant ways of starting this.) The base takes and lifts up the left foot of the flyer with both hands. The flyer will stand on the right foot.\n4. Important: The flyer keeps both legs locked and straight. The flyer’s left foot is flexed hard.\n5. As of now, the flyer is probably still balanced on the right foot. The flyer will start leaning out to the right while the base holds onto the flyer’s left foot with both hands.\n6. As the flyer increasingly leans to the right, the base will have to lean to the left to keep holding onto the flyer’s foot.\n7. The final position is that the flyer is leaning perhaps horizontally to the right. The base holds onto the flyer’s flex foot with one hand and the other hand is on the flyer’s calf to stabilize swinging.\n\n\nMotivation---\nThis exercise practices counterbalance. The flyer and base learn how to transfer weight to each other and match the weight transfer of their partner.\n\n\nCommon issues---\n- The flyer is often afraid to lean out and keeps all their weight on their own leg. The flyer needs to be encouraged to lean out.\n\n- “Swinging like a barndoor” is another common issue. That means as the base holds the flyer's foot, the flyer’s head becomes a very distant point. The distant point can have a tendency to very quickly and instantly swing like a big barn door. There isn’t an easy fix. Some things come very quickly out of balance, and one has to learn to keep them in balance.\n\n- The flyer’s foot on the ground could slip. However, if the base follows the instructions and places their foot directly on the inside of the flyer’s foot that should block any slippage.\n\n\nDeeper cuts---\n- A nice touch is when the flyer reaches their arms overhead and turns their torso to face the sky. It looks pretty.\n\n- With more skill, the flyer can lean out farther and farther until the flyer can almost lie down on the ground. The flyer may start on the floor and the base pulls them off the floor.",

Partner B will pike and end up in a handstand with their hip bent at a ninety-degree angle.

Plus, it practices coordination between two people.\n\n\nSafety---\nThere is a chance that the person on top will go forward. With their hands holding the partner’s ankles, they may not be able to braise their head forward tumble. Thus, it’s a good idea to have a spotter for the first time at the shoulders of partner B. Once people understand their body motions, they tend to be pretty confident on doing the exercise on their own.\n\n\nTips---\n- The base basically does a situp. If the flyer doesn’t help, the flyer can pin down the base. A lot of the move is driven by the flyer actively pulling their hips over their shoulders.\n\n- The base needs to be mindful of how much their are pushing the flyer forward or back. The base wants to be careful to keep the flyer’s shoulders over the flyer’s hands. If they are of different height, the base will have to accommodate the difference.",

You are looking to fit into a shape that is very flat.\n\n- If balance is hard, feel free to hold onto the wall or a chair.",

              "instructions": "1. Start in bird.\n2. The flyer folds forward and assumes straddle pike. This is called Folded Leaf.\n3. The base guides the flyer’s hand to hold the opposite ankle. The flyer will maintain this twisted position, providing a solid block for the base to maneuver.\n4. The base brings the flyer onto one foot so that the other foot becomes free. (See below for different strategies.)\n5. The base places the free foot in front of the other foot like third position in ballet (toes pointing out in opposite directions). The freet foot should slide in between the existing base foot and the flyer’s hips.\n6. The base removes the previous foot and finishes rotating the flyer 180 degrees.\n7. The base offers the newly free foot on the side of the hips of the flyer.\n8. The flyer places the top of their thigh on the free foot from the base.\n9. The flyer ends up in Straddle Bat. The pose is essentially like Folded Leaf, but rotated 180 degrees.\n\n\nChallenges---\nThe following challenges happen almost always when students learn this process:\n\n1. Initially, the base can’t take a foot away because the flyer’s weight is on both feet. See below for a deeper discussion.\n\n2. If the base gets the flyer on one foot, the base drops the flyer towards that side. Essentially, the base is similar to a sailboat. Because the keel is round, if you place all the weight on one side, the sailboat tilts that way. The remedy is that when a base takes the flyer on one foot, the base has to bring the supporting foot to their center. If they keep the foot on the side of their body, they are going to roll into that direction.\n\n3. If all the above is successful, virtual all new flyers will straighten their hips. Without offering the base a shelf (the thigh as a shelf), the base has nothing to push them up with. And the flyer falls down. The remedy is to repeat to the flyer that maintaining straddle bat throughout the maneuver is critical. Even emphasizing this, the flyer will likely not do it, but at least, they’ll be more responsive when they are asked to resume straddle bat.\n\n\nHow to bring the flyer onto one foot---\nThere are three main strategies to bring the flyer onto one foot of the base. They are discussed here with their pros and cons.\n\n1. The most common way this is taught is that the base pushes the back of the flyer up. The base’s hands will be over the base’s shoulders. The flyer twists so that their chest opens up to the ceiling and their free arm twists opposite. The twisting motion will spiral the flyer onto one foot.\n\nCon: The flyer has to be flexible, can’t have a big belly, and has to be fairly spatially aware to support this move. I’ve found a lot of first time flyers struggle to provide that support.\n\n2. The most straightforward way is that the base places their hands under the flyer’s shoulders and props up the flyer’s torso.\n\nCon: The base needs to be fairly strong to pull this off because the flyer is above the belly of the base. And that’s anatomically not a strong position for the base to push up on.\n\n3. The most feasible way given flyer and base limitations are to tilt the flyer in the opposite direction of the base’s target foot. Picture the base’s target foot being the right foot. The base would push the upper chest of the base to the left until the base’s left foot is free. Because the arm’s aren’t strong in this position, the base can smartly bend the knees and use the knees to lever the flyer to the side.\n\n\nTip---\nAs you notice from the length of the discussions of challenges with this short move, there might be a lot to figure out. If you try to muscle through or try to do it all at once on the first try, it’s likely going to be a mangle that’s hard to troubleshoot. However, you can go very slowly and step by step.\n\n1. Shift the flyer onto one base foot.\n2. If the flyer falls out, the base didn’t center the foot well.\n3. Remind the flyer to go back to straddle pike because they likely went out of it.\n4. You are almost home now. Offer the free foot for the flyer to put their thigh on.\n\nA spotter can also provide a very hands-on spot so that the base and flyer can get a feel for the general direction of everything.\n\n\nSpotting---\n1. The spotter starts with the usual bird spotting: One arm under the belly and one under the thighs of the flyer. The spotter should maintain goddess stance.\n\n2. As the flyer goes to Folded Leaf, the spotter walks around to be behind the back of the flyer. The spotter’s hands should be under the flyer’s thighs near the hip.\n\n3. As the flyer is rotated to Straddle Bat, the spotter should follow maintaining behind the flyer’s back and hands under the flyer’s thighs near the hip.",

              "instructions": "Straddle Bat is the pose that the last move ended in. So this isn’t a new pose. However, because it’s so central, it should be its own lesson that people can find. Getting into it through paserita twist is one option. This lesson gives two other options.\n\nThe pose itself has the flyer in straddle bat. They are hanging from the top of their thighs near the hip. The flyer’s torso is in between the base’s legs. The flyer faces towards the head of the base.\n\n\nOption 1: Entering Straddle Bat Directly---\n1. The base has their feet up and stacked. The flyer is standing below the base and faces away from the base.\n2. The flyer places their hands on the feet of the base to prepare to hang from the feet.\n3. The flyer leans back between the base’s legs and hangs from the base’s feet by the arms.\n4. The goal of the flyer is to lever their thighs onto the base’s feet. This is easiest accomplished by first balling up into a ball by tucking the knees to the chest.\n5. Once the flyer is in a ball, the flyer can relatively easily shoot the legs up towards the sky.\n6. There might be some shuffling needed to get perfectly into straddle bat. The flyer can be very hands-on. The base can help by pushing the flyer up by the shoulders.\n\n\nOption 2: Entering Straddle Bat Through Back Flying---\n1. Begin with back flying. Back flying will be taught later. It’s essentially like bird but the flyer is flipped around and the base’s feet are on the flyer’s butt. To enter back flying, the flyer stands facing away from the base. The base’s feet are on the flyer’s butt. The flyer and base connect hands. The flyer hops back onto the base’s feet.\n\n2. Going from back flying to straddle bat requires careful coordination between the flyer’s and base’s motion. The base slips their feet from the flyer’s butt to the side of the hips to end up in the straddle bat position. The base can hold the flyer in back flying well with the feet on the back. However, once the base’s feet slip to the side of the flyer’s hips, the flyer would fall through. The flyer has to enter straddle pike early enough to prevent a fall.\n\n\nSpotting---\nEntering directly is best spotting by the spotter putting a hand under the flyer’s shoulder.\n\nEntering through back flying is also well spotted by teh spotter putting a hand under the flyer’s shoulder. However, at certain times like near the end position, having the spotter be under the thighs near the hip is going to be better.",

              "synopsis": "Learning side star is a major step in the progression of very acroyoga journey.",
              "instructions": "1. Start in straddle bat.\n2. The base offers the arms straight up from the shoulder. The flyer connects hands (two fingers on the wrist and two fingers wrapped - see below).\n3. The flyer pushes on the base’s arms. The goal of the flyer is to pivot around the left foot of the base so that the flyer’s torso lifts up to horizontal.\n4. The flyer should end up in side star.\n\n\nAlternative entry---\n1. The flyer stands at the level of the base’s hip on the side of the base.\n2. The flyer’s foot points towards the base’s hip.\n3. The flyer assumes the side star position while maintaining their weight on their own.\n4. The flyer should place their hand roughly on the inside of the base’s leg near the knee. The flyer’s arm should be straight.\n5. The base places the closest foot on the flyter’s hip bone as close as possible to the crook.\n6. The flyer should NOT try to put weight on the base but simply shift their weight towards the other side of the base.\n7. When the base feels like the weight of the flyer is on the base’s leg, the base should push the flyer up and straighten the foot.\n\n\nDiscussion: Entering side star from the ground or from straddle bat---\nTraditionally, side star is taught by entering from the floor. To many people it seems simpler because they are starting from the ground. However, there is a major difficulty that often occupies beginners fruitlessly for a very long time. The flyer tries to put their weight on the base down. The base tries to lift the flyer up. That opposite down and up movement tends to destabilize the two. (If you followed the instructions, the flyer doesn’t put the weight down but across.)\n\nEntering side star from straddle bat challenges the flyer to visualize how their body is supposed to rotate from facing down to facing the side. However, all the movements, the base and flyer work in the same direction. Thus aside from the conceptual challenges, the movement is more straight forward.\n\n\nTypes of side stars---\nIf you pay keen attention, the two side stars above are actually different side stars. With one the head of the flyer faces away from the base and the other one across the base. If you take it mathematically, there are eight different side stars possible.\n\n- Inside vs. outside side star: The head of the flyer indicates if its an inside or outside side star. If the head faces away from the base, it’s an outside side star. If the head faces across the base, it’s an inside side star.\n\n- Regular vs. reverse side star: The face of the flyer can face towards the head of the base (regular side star) or away (reverse side star).\n\n- Left vs right foot of the base: Self explanatory.\n\nThus, one could have a reverse outside side star on the left foot of the base. You can use the above to decipher what that means.\n\n\nSpotting---\nThe main concern for spotting side star is that the flyer could tilt towards their head and fall onto it. Typically, the spotter has their hands on both side of the flyer’s hips. The spotter usually stays on the back of the flyer. Flyers often rotate in side star as well as continue with rotations into other directions. The spotter follows behind the back of the flyer. Spotting is often a dance where the spotter has to keep moving around.\n\n\nPerspective---\nLearning side star is hard compared to the other poses that we have learned so far. The other poses are relatively easy. Some students will get it on the first try. Other students will get it after three or so tries. However, side star can often take multiple sessions. It requires a lot of balance for the flyer and the base.\n\nSide star is a key pose that will provide essential for many machines to come. Bird, throne, side star, and star are frequent elements of machines. You want to develop good skill in these poses. Particularly, you want to practice range of motion exercises that’ll help you in the future with transitions into and out of them.\n\nAnd, no! You can’t simply learn one side star on your good side. You are going to need to learn all the side star versions because they are going to come up in future machines.",

The flyer jumps their hips over their shoulder to enter a shoulderstand.\n\n\nMotivation:---\nThis level is about introducing star pose (inversion on the base’s feet). This particular warm-up is an easy way to experience an inversion and become comfortable with being upside down. Even if flyers don’t have headstands, shoulderstands, or handstands in their practice, this is a pretty easy way to get inverted.\n\n\nTip:---\n- The base can squeeze their thighs around the flyer’s neck to help with stability.\n\n- If the base raises their arms up, the base can spot a flyer when the flyer falls backwards. Simply aim for the butt of the falling flyer and support.\n\n- If a flyer struggles to get inverted a scissor lift can help:\n(1) The flyer raises one leg as high as possible.\n(2) The helper puts a hand under the foot in the air so that the flyer can push against it.\n(3) The flyer raises their second leg and with the help of the supported foot and bring the second leg vertical.\n\n\nSpotting:---\nThe spotter should have the hands on both sides of the flyer’s hips to control falls in any direction.\n\n\nDeeper Cuts:---\nOnce the flyer is a little bit comfortable, it’s a good idea to start doing leg motions to develop comfort in inversion:\n- Legs straight up\n- Front split\n- Side split\n- Knees tugged to the chest\n",

From this crouch, it’s relatively easy to slowly stand up. Obviously, the base can’t stand up straight without the flyer falling off. The base has to stand hunched forward to give the flyer as flat as a surface as possible.

(This pose may be well familiar to students who have learned it as kids in PhysEd. However, some students have never learned this.)\n\n\nTips---\n- A partner can help with a hand on the back to slow down the roll initially. That avoids slamming the back on the ground.\n\n- If the back slams on the ground, the student doesn’t round their back enough.\n\n- If the student jumps into the roll, encourage them not to jump but simply roll.\n\n\nDeeper Cuts---\nThe roll can be done in reverse, which is a good exercise. The mechanics are slightly different.\n\n1. Again start by tugging the chin onto the chest.\n2. Sit on the butt.\n3.

Tripod headstand is a great way to explore leg range mobility and to simply become familiar with being upside down on your own terms.\n\n\nAlternative:---\nA different arm placement might make finding balance harder but provide more comfort for the head. Place your hands on the ground so that your index fingertips and thumb tips are touching the same of the opposite hand. In between the thumbs and index finger should be a vague rectangle. You can use this as a cradle for your. And then your forearms will be flat on the ground, creating an open-sided triangle.\n\n\nTips:---\n- You can use a wall or spotter to prevent falling over.\n- A folded-up yoga mat or other cushion may provide more comfort for the head to be on the ground.\n- A partner can put their fist between the ankles of the inverted person and ask to squeeze. This can help create better alignment.\n- Some people do not know how to align their bodies headover. A partner can help guide the inverted person into a more balanced position.

There is an entire level later dedicated to intermediate-level star.\n\n\nHand Connection---\nThe hand connection is unexpected and a little challenging for beginners to pick up. However, it’s important. Practicing the very first warm-up “Flashlights” now demonstrates why it’s such a beneficial practice. Like in the warm-up, the focus is on pushing the two base knuckles of the index and middle finger out. Beginners tend to have a challenge to differentiate between turning their wrist and pushing those two knuckles out.\n\nTo prepare, the flyer and base want to get a good visualizing of where the two base knuckles of the index and middle finger are as well as the fleshy mound/pillow below the thumb on the palm. The flyer’s two knuckles shoulder press agains the upper edge fo the base’s fleshy mound below the thumb on the palm. The base wants to do the same to the flyer.\n\nThus the hand connection is at those two connection points. The hands shouldn’t slide in towards each other like a handshake where the webbing between the thumb and index finger gets stuck against each other. It’s not only a bad connection, but also painful.\n\nWith the hand thus connected, the partners should put the index and middle finger on the wrist of their partner and wrap the ring and pinkie finger around the back of the palm of the partner. “Two on the wrist and two wrapped” is the saying to remember this.\n\nThe next choice is the angle at the wrist. There are two extreme cases. The wrist can be completely straight (steep) or complietely flat (bent backwards). The preferred wrist angle is somewhere in between. Individual wrists are different. It’s good for the flyer and base to negotiate an angle that feels mutually good. Once the angle is chosen with the flyer on the ground, the same angle should be locked in and maintained.\n\n\nSpotting---\nThe spotter should be partially behind the base’s legs and partially to the side of them. The goal is to strike a happy medium between having the spotter’s body in the way of the flyer falling backwards and still being able to observe the face of the base. (Facial expressions are often early warning signs of trouble.)\n\nThe hand of the spotter should be hover a quarter inch close to both sides of the flyer’s hip.\n\nBe sure to reach forward as the flyer comes up and guide the flyer all the way down when they exit. Novice flyers may feel scared of exiting and stepping on the base’s head. It’s unlikely to happen, but a little extra assurance by slowing them down can be comforting.\n\n\nHow To Get Into Star---\nMany flyers have initially trouble getting into star. Most people can be coached through it. Here are tips on how to get into star. They are listed in the order that makes the most sense to work through them.\n\n1. Lower the base’s feet as much as possible. A lower base means less distance for the flyer to get up.\n\n2. The flyer should be fairly close to the base. Flyers tend to walk their feet away from the base due to flexibility especially when the base lowers the feet more. However, flyers need to be close to the base as this allows them to direct their jump energy up instead of forward to get to the base.\n\n3. One of the biggest issues and the one which flyers are often stuck on for a long time is this: The focus should NOT be to jump up but to press their flyer’s shoulders down onto the base. With that focus, flyers tend to jump up their whole body and even lift their shoulders off the feet of the base. Instead by focusing on rolling forward, the flyers keep their shoulders on the bases feet and focus more on using their arms and core to press their legs up.\n\n4. Round the flyer’s back. Like in the forward roll, the more the flyer rounds their back, the closer they are to already being up.\n\n5. Base’s need to present strong arms as high as possible. (Beginning base’s often bend their arms.) The more a flyer presses into the hand connection the less jump is needed. Accomplished flyers can enter star without jumping at all, simply by pressing.\n\nNote: There is a tendency to help struggling flyers too early. It’s a gift to allow a flyer a few attempts to figure it out on their own before they are placed into the position.\n\n\nHow To Balance In Star---\nTo some degree, the base and flyer have to gain experience in this position to balance better. Flyer’s might feel so disoriented that they need some guidance from a spotter to find their balance. However, there are specific things to do to improve the balance. Below is a list that everyone should implement.\n\n1. The flyer should relax their neck. There is a tendency to have at tense neck because everything is so exciting. However, the neck muscles aren’t needed. Relaxing the neck muscles allows the base’s feet to sink deeper and create a better connection. (Think of how a pumped-up ball easily rolls away, but a flat deflated ball stays in place.)\n\n2. The flyer’s arms should be bent and as close as possible at a ninety-degree angle. There should be weight in them. The center of gravity of the flyer should be between their shoulders and hands. Balancing entirely on the shoulders is a more difficult skill. Plus, it provides some assurance that the flyer won’t fall backwards.\n\n3. The base should put their heels together and the flyer should press the back of their head against the base’s shin. This creates extra stability.\n\n4. When the flyer holds their legs in a side split, it’s the most stable leg position. As the flyer becomes more comfortable, the flyer can venture out into more precarious leg positions.\n\n\nSport Vs. Comfort Foot Position (and other considerations)---\nRather than thinking of a correct foot position, there are different placements for different purposes. The main choice is to keep the feet in a V with the heels touching or to keep the feet parallel. You can think of this choice as the comfort versus the sports version. The V position allows the flyer to push their head back and gets extra stability. The parallel position is less stable, yet allows the flyer to move into different positions as well as exit into or enter from different positions.\n\nThe other choice is where on the base’s foot to place the flyer’s shoulders. For example, if the flyer’s is on the balls of the feet, the flyer has considerable “runway” towards the back. This allows the flyer to lean backwards. If the flyer brings their feet forward as a counterbalance, a flyer can lean their body almost horizontally back.\n\nIn the opposite direction, if the flyer is on the base’s heel, the base can offer the feet on the flyer’s chest for the flyer lean forward. If the base needs to get the feet out easily, it might make sense to place the flyer even onto the toes of the base. A common usage of that is to enter hand-to-hand and be able to very gently pull the feet out.\n\n\nLeg Range Of Motion---\nAs earlier mentioned, in inversions, it’s good to go through legs straight up, side split, front split, knees to chest, and so on.\n\nAnother good thing is to play with the counterbalance between he hips and the feet. A flyer can bring their hips backwards and their feet forward. If the weight of either side of their shoulder is equal, the flyer can fold their legs towards their chest that way.\n\nA useful variation of that is to pancake. A pancake on the floor is when you sit with your legs straight and wide while you touch your chest on the floor. Trying to assume the same thing inverted in the air is “pancaking.” Practicing this is very useful for future progressions.",

              "synopsis": "Another iconic pose for your quiver.",
              "instructions": "Before starting the pose, it’s a good idea to feel the hand connection first:\n1. The flyer! lies down on their belly and bends the feet to a ninety-degree angle to present the feet.\n2. The base can now connect the hands to find the right position and show the flyer the preferred foot angle. (For hand connection, see below.)\n3. The flyer should memorize the foot angle and commit it to memory.\n\nReady to do actual foot-to-hand:\n1. The base lies on their back with their legs nicely stacked. The elbows are on the ground at the side. The wrist is stacked right on top of the elbow.\n2. The flyer steps over the belly of the base looking at the base’s feet.\n3. The flyer will hold the base’s feet for support.\n4. The flyer will lift and present a foot.\n5. The base will grab the foot, adjust the grip, and angle. (For hand connection, see below).\n6. The base will place their elbow on the ground.\n7. The flyer should wait until the base gives the go ahead to put weight on the base.\n8. The same is repeated on the other side. (The flyer should not rush but go through the same presenting and weighting for the elbow to be placed before putting any weight on.)\n9. As the flyer is now standing, the flyer can try to balance without holding onto the base’s feet.\n10. To step down, the flyer can put their weight on the base’s feet.\n\nNote: Flyers often assume priority and extra consideration. In this pose, it’s the base’s fragile wrist against the entire body weight of the flyer. Thus, the base requires priority and extra consideration. For example, flyers tend to right away step on the base. Instead, the flyer should present the foot and allow the base to choose the preferred angle and place the foot in position before placing any weight on it. Flyers may assume that their balance takes priority and tell the base how to hold the foot. In this case, serious pain and injury can come from this. The flyer has to work to achieve the hand position and angle that the base needs.\n\n\nMotivation---\nThis is a wonderful dimension to stretch the yoga practice into. Standing on the base and holding the base with the hands is a different realm and opens up many wonderful opportunities.\n\n\nSpotting---\nThe spotter should stand on the side of the flyer. The spotter should put one arm in front and one arm behind the flyer at the hip level to create a “cage.” if the flyer were to fall, the spotter can bear hug the flyer to catch him or her.\n\nThis is a case where a base can benefit from spotting as well. The base can be at risk of having their arms pushed out and to hurt their shoulder. A spotter can place a foot where the base’s elbow is on the ground. That way the spotter’s shin can prevent the base from having their arm getting twisted outwards.\n\n\nFoot Connection---\nThere are different ways to connect the base’s hand and the flyer’s foot. Some instructors will teach that only one ways is correct. Others will admit that different preferences exist, particularly if the instructor found that they prefer a different hold.\n\nThe most common connection has the base focus the base knuckles of their index and middle finger on the distal part (the side towards the toes) of the flyer’s heel. The heel is a pretty easily discernable oval shape. The base’s index and middle finger go across the heel. The base’s ring and pinkie finger wrap around the arch of the foot.\n\nThe important part is the angle of the ankle. The base has to choose an angle that works for them. The flyer must maintain the angle. Usually, the base tries to accommodate the flyer. However, in this case, the weight of the flyer is of a much larger magnitude than the strength of a human wrist. Thus, to avoid injury, the flyer has to accomodate the base.\n\nA common alternative is the Lego-person grip or C-grip. The flyer makes a C-shape with their hand. The index finger and thumb create the C-shape. The base puts the C-shape across the flyer’s foot.\n\nOther variations are that the base only puts one finger over the flyer’s heel and the rest around the flyer’s arch of the foot.\n\nPersonally, I use the C-grip with beginning flyers. I’ve experienced too many beginning flyers leaning into their heels to create pain. Even flyers who aren’t that bad tend to build up enough discomfort in the wrist to where one has to stop basing after a few minutes. With the C-grip, the base’s wrist is protected. When a flyer can maintain a good angle, I switch to the other grip because it allows more control.\n\n\nTips---\n- Communicating “more toes” or “more heels” is a way for the base to ask to change the angle of the flyer’s foot. It’s important to talk about this before.\n\n- Sometimes based on hand/foot geometry, flyers will feel that they have to balance on their heels. Some of them believe that it’s impossible to give more toes (change the ankle angle like one would when wearing a taller high heel). However, it’s quite possible. One can simple stand on a stair by only having the heel on the stair and the rest of the foot overhanging. One can raise and lower the front of the foot in that position. This image (or actually) trying out might help a flyer who believes this to be impossible.\n\n\nDeeper Cuts/Progressions---\nTypically, a flyer/base pair will start with this exercise by having the flyer put a lot of their body weight onto the base’s feet. As the flyer becomes more comfortable, the flyer can take more weight out of their hands until hands are no longer needed.\n\nThe base may ease this transition by supporting the flyer’s balance with the base’s knees. Some flyers get used to this support, but the base should take it eventually away.\n\nThe next step is to do foot-to-hand with extended arms. This means the base lifts their elbows of the ground and straightens their arms.\n\nTypically, this is first attempted by using a process called “boxing up.” The flyer holds the base’s feet and puts as much weight as possible on the base’s feet. This eases the load on the flyer’s arms to make it easier for the base to press up the arms. Once the base has extended and locked out their arms, the flyer can transfer their weight back onto the base’s hands.\n\nThis seems to be called boxing up because from the side, the silhouette of the flyer and base are a rectangle (= box-shaped).\n\n\nAbout Pose Names---\nA common acroyoga naming convention is to state two body parts. Those are the two body parts that are connected. The first body part always belongs to the flyer. The second body part belongs to the base.\n\nSo “foot-to-hand” means the flyer’s foot is on top of the base’s hand. In contrast, “hand-to-foot” means the flyer’s hands are on the base’s feet. (I’m not sure that there is a convention for what the latter actually means. The flyer could be doing a handstand or an L-sit on the flyer’s feet.)",

The related reverse straddle throne is more comfortable. However, reverse throne is a useful in between pose to exit out of the foot-to-hand. The base can easily place the flyer on the ground from here. In case of instability, the base can often also catch the flyer with this pose.\n\n\nMotivation---\nLearning reverse throne is a good complement to foot-to-hand. It’s also a way that an unsteady flyer can be caught when being upright and facing away from the base from a variety of transitions.\n\n\nTips---\nDevelop a stable foot-to-hand before attempting this.\n\nFor less stable base/flyer pairs, it can be helpful to leave one of the base’s feet in front of the flyer and one behind. That way, the base can transition one foot at a time in place while helping the flyer stabilize.",

Equal weight should be in front of the flyer’s shoulders (the weight of the legs) and behind the flyer’s shoulders (the butt sticking out).

Relax and let your arms swing more and body move.\n4. Observe how there is natural opposition of the opposite leg and arm moving forward.\n5. Observe and notice the natural inclination of the hip to rotate in the opposite direction of the chest.\n6. Walk like a New Yorker, very tense and pointed.\n7. Walk like you own a beach bar in the Caribbean, your shirt is open, a beer is in your hand, and the ocean breeze is caressing your skin. Notice how your hips swing a lot more.\n8. Walk like you are a black panther stalking. Observe all the isolations in your body and how your wagging, invisible tail makes you move as well.\n\n\nMotivation:---\nMost new dance students move very awkwardly and struggle with basic movements. It’s like as soon as they are in a dance studio, they forget to move. There is a neurological explanation. Our conscious awareness comes mostly from the prefrontal cortex of the brain. If we try to move consciously, we use the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is very good at solving complicated problems. However, it can only hold a very limited number of things in its attention. It’s not very well suited for learning movement - even though that’s how most dance instruction has been traditionally delivered.\n\nThe motor cortex is really good at doing whole-body movements. We spend years developing motor programs of complex movements like walking, riding a bicycle, or reaching for a jar on a high shelf. You may think of reaching for a jar on a high shelf as an arm movement only. However, your shoulder has to lift. Your hips have to tilt for an extra inch. And your opposite foot might reach out to counterbalance. All of that happens without us thinking about it. We think about the goal and allow the motor cortex to execute its motor program.\n\nThis introduction exercise takes a motor program that you’ve been practicing for twenty or more years - “walking” - and makes you play with it by giving you different imagery. As you observe yourself, you’ll notice that all the styling movements that you need for bachata dancing are hinted at and already included in your natural walking skill. Using insights from your walking study will give you movement patterns that you will be able to reuse in bachata movement technique (instead of trying to learn them from scratch).\n\n\nCommon Problems:---\n1. NOT MOVING TO THE MUSIC: Some students with little dance background will walk completely disconnected from the music. The music may appear like an impenetrable forest. I believe the movie “Dead Poet Society” had a scene where the teacher asked the students NOT to move to the beat. After fifteen minutes, even the iron-willed student succumbed to the music. This is a promise that if you relax, the music will take over. The more you try, the more tense you may become, and the more blocked from the music you may be. This exercise may move you forward by quantum leaps. Simply focus your mind on the music, relax, and keep walking. You may have a blissful surprise experience that suddenly you start to feel things in the music like the beat.\n\n2. STIFF, TIGHT MOVEMENTS: Some students will naturally walk very stiffly. They won’t move their arms at all. There is no swing in the hips. This is an excellent exercise to work on before getting bombarded with technique. Moving stiff and tight may be the natural result of living a life that’s very office desk focused and may also have components of feeling shy or disconnected from the body. Walking and letting a hand move back and forth may be start. Feel how the swing of the hand gives you a natural impetus for your leg to swing in the opposite way. Observe how these natural impulses and momentums become stronger and weaker. An arm swinging at the top of its range before it changes directions is slower than at the bottom of the pendulum swing. When you allow more of this to happen, you’ll start feeling pulls on your hips and shoulders as well. Observe and allow more of this to happen. You are developing a relationship to your body.",

Press the balls of your feet onto the ground. Press your heel down. Repeat with the other foot. This familiarizes us with your foot.\n\n3. Change the pattern to only go between the balls of the feet and the heels while pressing to the beat of the music. This familiarizes us with pressing into the ground.\n\n\n4. Continue the movement. Additionally, when you are on the balls of your feet, allow your knee to bend more. This should make the hip drop down. Keep the chest still and in place. You’ll find it challenge to coordinate all these body parts. Mentally focus on relaxing the side of your body and let the actual movement be a result of your focus to relax.\n\n5. Let the last exercises go. Imagine that your legs extend into your belly and have become tree trunks that don’t move. Hold your arms straight out to the side. Move your shoulders side to side. Importantly, your shoulders parallel to the ground. You can visualize this more as your rib cage sliding left and right rather than a tilt. Do this to the music for a while.\n\n6. The arms straight out to the side were there to help you keep your shoulders horizontal. Let your arms come down and in front of your belly as if you are holding a baby.\n\n7. If you feel comfortable with the ribcage movement, turn your hands over and start moving you arms subtly as a consequence of your chest movement, not on their own.\n\n8. Let the last exercise go. Return to the first exercise, where you were kneading the ground with your feet and allowed your knees and hips to move with the movement. Do that for a while to music to bring it back to mind.\n\n9. Keep going with the lower body exercise and now introduce the upper body exercise. When you are on the balls of your feet, your knee above should relax, the hip tilt down, and the ribcage should move on top of it to that side.\n\n\nMotivation:---\nYou may have seen ballroom dancers with completely stiff upper bodies gliding over the dancefloor in an embrace that doesn’t change. That’s not bachata! The body movements are very important in interpreting and enjoying the music. Stylistically, this is what makes dancers look good. Practically, to lead and dance the sensual movements, we have to dedicate a big focus on developing these movements.\n\nA saying is that you are only as advanced as your basic. With that, people don’t mean that you know the basic step pattern but that you know how to move your body. Some beginners may feel uncomfortable with these movements. They may also innocently disregard it as unfamiliar and probably unimportant. Yet this is the heart of dancing bachata.\n\n\nTips:---\nThere is no intellectual shortcut to learning movement technique. It requires practice.\n\nRoute repetition is maybe what old dance cliches suggest. However, if you are mentally checked out and repeating the same movement for hours, you are not learning a lot. Instead, put on a bachata song that you like (or even explore non-bachata music) and move your body to the music roughly within the parameters of the prescribed movement. (Don’t go all old disco side step here.)\n\nPlay a little with the music. If the music goes lower, let your body go lower. Play with what if you move your hips more side to side horizontally or tilt them up and down. Play with making the movement way too big and then way too small. What can you learn from that? Does this unlock something new in your body? Try to not do anything and focus only on the music to let your body surprise you in which new ways it suddenly moves intuitively.\n",

              "instructions": "1. Repeat the body movement from the previous lesson to music.\n\n2. Once you are comfortable doing the body movement, take a step to the side and a step together. You want to coordinate your step with your ribcage moving in the same direction. Keep going like that all the way to the other side of the room. Keep walking side-to-side like that.\n\n3. If you are comfortable with that, start switching directions sooner. Take three steps. Tap your foot and start in the other direction for three steps and a tap. Keep going in your small “box.”\n\n\nMotivation:---\nThe basic step pattern of three steps and a tap is often taught right away. It makes people very focused on intellectualizing the steps. By starting with a merengue movement, it doesn’t take a lot of mental focus and we can stay focused on the quality of the body movement. Once moving side-to-side starts becoming automatic, we can make another small change to do the actual bachata basic.\n\n\nBachata Basic Step Pattern:---\nSummary: (Moving left) Left, right, left, tap; (Moving right) right, left, right, tap.\n\n0. To start, stand with your weight on your right foot. Your left foot is tapped. Tapped means that there is no weight on it. The heel is up. The balls of the foot are next to the middle of the foot with the weight.\n\n1. Start by shifting your ribcage to the left and step out with the left foot. Commit your complete body weight.\n\n2. Shift your ribcage back to the right. Move the right foot to meet the left foot and commit your body weight.\n\n3. Make another step to the left.\n4. Push your ribcage again to the left. Your right hip should pop up a bit. Place tap your right foot next to your left foot.\n\n5-8. Repeat in the other direction.\n\n\nTips:---\n- It’s easy to get confused on the steps. Always commit 100% of your weight to the foot that you stepped with (unless it’s a tap.) That will make clear which foot to use next: The one without weight. Then it becomes almost a no-brainer.\n\n- The hips should swing opposite to the step direction and the shoulder movement. Think “leaving your hips behind” when stepping. More technically precise, you want your hip movements to be on the “and” in the music. The “and” is the midpoint between two beats.",

On the tap, keep your chest on the same side and pop your tapping hip a little up.\n\n2. Practice sensual hips: Circle one knee. Once that works, allow the knee circles to move the hip on that side. Repeat with the other knee. Keep switching between the knees in shorter and shorter intervals until you switch after each circle. Your hips should now be doing an infinity circle.\n\n3. Alternative practice for sensual hips: Move your left hip towards the front left corner of the room. Circle the left hip back towards the back left corner of the room. Slide your hips diagonally forward so that your right hip goes towards the front right corner of the room. Circle your right hip back towards the back right corner. Keep going. (Also try reversing the direction.)\n\n4. Sensual hips: Do the sensual hips while doing the basic.\n\n5. Practice circular hips: Move your hips in a big circle. Try the other direction as well.\n\n6. Circular hips: Do the basic while moving your hips in a big circle. You can start the circle moving forward with the hips and backward. Try both!\n\n7. Bonus: U-hips: As you start on 1, your hips dip down. On 2, they come back up. You continue like that.\n\n\nMotivation:---\nHip movements are a big part of bachata. Which once you choose depends on your styling choice and the music. Traditional and sensual hips are the main choices and come from the traditional and respectively sensual bachata. As such, they have their own flavor that might fit better to different music and sections within a song. Circular hips are less common but a styling option. The U-shaped movement is rarely taught, but a fun thing to have in your back pocket if the moment calls for it.\n\n\nCommon problems:---\n- SHOULDER AND HIP DISSOCIATION: Some beginners have trouble moving their hips and shoulders in opposite directions. This is a key skill to develop for Latin dances. There are various tricks that help people figure it out. For example, try to touch your knee to your opposite elbow. This naturally rotates the hips and shoulder in opposite directions. Another one is to look over your shoulder and try to see your butt cheek on the other side.\n\n- HIP INFINITY CIRCLES: These tend to be tricky for people. The instructions outline two different ways to learn them. Follow those instructions very slowly. Slower means that you have an easier time doing it. Keep repeating it, focusing on precision instead of speed. You’ll notice that you’ll naturally speed up as the movement gets more ingrained until you can do it to the speed of music.",

              "instructions": "(It’s the same movement for each part of the exercise. However, where you place your mental focus and what body part drives the movement changes.)\n\n1. CHEST-LED: Do the bachata basic with the hip and chest movement techniques as we learned it so far. However, place your conscious focus on your chest and how your chest leads into whichever direction you step. For example, as you step to the left, you lean your chest to the left. As a consequence to keep your balance, your hips will have to move to the right to counterbalance. Your whole body is shifted as a consequence of your chest movement. We want to think of our mental focus on one body part, and the rest of the body moves as a consequence without us putting focus onto it.\n\n2. HIP-LED: We are doing the same thing as the previous part. The difference is that we are focusing on our hip and allowing everything else to move as a consequence. Notice how each body part brings a different quality. The hips have a lot of control. Thus, they can capture and mimic the feel of an instrument or voice very well. Sounds have a quality to them, like flat, hollow, sharp, light, heavy, and so on. You can capture that very well with the hips.\n\n3. FOOT-LED: We are repeating the same exercise. However, this time, we are focusing on the feet and allowing everything else to move as a consequence. The energetic quality to focus on is to “draw energy from the floor” and push into the floor. Another tactile quality to play with is to massage the floor in the way that a cat kneads one with its paws.\n\n\nMOTIVATION---\nMost students encounter the body and in particular hip movements at some point in a class. However, as soon as the class moves on from hip exercises to stepping, they forget all about the body movements. It’s difficult and feels awkward. So they avoid it. Instructors will often repeatedly call to move the hips, but that call becomes repetitive and ignored. This lesson offers a way to develop the hip movement without being repetitive. By shifting the focus, it gives the mind something to do. Plus, it allows us to improve different aspects of the movement technique.\n\n\nNOTE\nHip-led doesn't mean that the hip moves first in the direction of movement. The movement pattern still stays the same. The hip stays behind. It's the internal focus that changes - not the movement.",

              "instructions": "This lesson is a mixture of lecture and body drumming exercises to experience the musical concept. Body drumming is using your own body to create rhythm, e.g. clap your hands, slap your thighs, pound your chest. You’ll have to keep the body drumming rhythm for a few minutes until your music ear starts picking up on the feeling of the particular exercise. The reason is that at first, you’ll do the exercise using your conscious mind. When the exercise becomes automatic, your musical feeling will take over. And the goal of the exercise is to develop your musical feeling. If you only do the exercise once and out of rhythm, you won’t get the benefit out of it.\n\n\nLECTURE: TIME SIGNATURE:---\nBefore medieval times (and outside of Western music), musical notes used to go all over the place without a clear start, end, or pattern. Then some people realized that if we put the notes into regular groupings of notes, it gives the ears something recognizable. The groupings are called bars. And the type of grouping is described by its time signature.\n\nYou’ve probably seen numbers at the start of sheet music. There are often two numbers over each other like a fraction, but they don’t have a line in between. That’s the time signature. The top number describes how many notes are in a bar. The bottom number describes the duration of the notes. For example, 3 over 4 says that there are 3 notes in the bar. And they are a quarter (1/4) long. Another example is 2 over 2: Two notes that are half a note long (1/2).\n\n\nLECTURE: METER:---\nAn observant person may ask: How does one know where a bar starts and ends? After all if all the notes sounded the same, they may appear as groups on the sheet music, but there is no way to hear where the bar starts and ends.\n\nThe meter answers that question. The meter describes which notes are stressed and unstressed. By the convention of Western music, the first note in a bar is always stressed.\n\nExamples:\n- Unmetered: If we slap our thighs left and right perfectly equally, we have an unmetered sound. There is no meter. There is no emphasis.\n\n- 2 over 2: If we slap hard with the left hand on the thigh and softly with the right, we create a sound that sounds like marching music: LEFT - right - LEFT - right. And most marching music is in a meter with 2 on top.\n\n- 3 over 4: If we want to create a 3 over 4 meter, we have to slap HARD - soft - soft - HARD - soft - soft. You’ll notice that this is familiar from the Viennese Waltz. Indeed, they are written in that meter. The dance is often a big step forward and two small steps in place. Thus the movement mimics the meter.\n\n- 4 over 4: We have finally arrived at the time signature for bachata: 4 over 4. You may have an expectation about what the meter should be based on the current rule. However, it’s a little different. 4 over 4 is: STRONG - weak - Medium - weak - STRONG… Yes, we’ve introduced medium-strong beats into the music.\n\n\nEXERCISE: METER:---\nLet’s practice this meter. If you are at home, take 10-15 minutes or longer to play with STRONG - weak - MEDIUM - weak at the experiential level. You are training your ears. This isn’t simply a logical concept to understand.\n\nLet’s start with a body drumming exercise. When you clap your hands, you create a very loud sound. Let’s use that for “STRONG.” When you slap your thighs, you create a pretty loud sound but not as loud. Let’s use that for “Medium.” When you tap your chest, it’ll create a pretty muted sound. Let’s use that for “weak.”\n\nOpen your phone and search for “metronome.” Google search will give you a metronome tool. It’ll allow you to select a speed (BPM). Start the metronome. This will give you a constant beat so that you stay on time. Then start clapping to it. Once you are synced with the metronome, try to create the bachata meter:\n1. Clap your hands (“STRONG”)\n2. Tap your chest (“weak”)\n3. Slap your thigh (“Medium”)\n4. Tap your chest (“weak”)\n5. Start at 1 again.\n\nNow that you have a bit of a feel for it. Let’s try to create 4/4 by slapping your thigh. You have to slap your thigh harder and softer based on the meter. This takes a little more skill to keep the time of the metronome and dose the strength of your slaps.\n\nNow that this is working, try to squeeze someone’s shoulder (not painfully hard) to transmit 4/4 with stronger, medium, and weaker squeezes.\n\nYou are on a roll! Try to to create the 4/4 meter with your voice. Pick something like “la” and sing: LA - la - La - la\n\n\nLECTURE: FINDING THE METER IN MUSIC---\nPlay a bachata song and see if you can find the pulse in music (STRONG - weak - Medium - weak). Usually, not a single instrument will play continuously on the beat during a bar. The beat is created by all the instruments and the voice working together.\n\nOn a side note, bachata is actually a polyrhythm. Poly means many. Each instrument has its own rhythm. Their combination is what gives us the overall beat.\n\nPeople often listen for the bongos to find a strong bongo sound indicating the start of a musical bar. However, you can also listen to the voice. Each syllable will have a different amount of stress placed on it. And the stress follows the meter.\n\n\nLECTURE: FINDING THE 1 IN MUSIC---\nIf you are very perceptive, you may notice that a musical bar has 4 notes but the bachata basic has 8 steps. This discrepancy is actually very common in dance. For musicians, small units of 2, 3, or 4 notes are usually very handy. However, dancers can’t do much with such a short unit. The solution is that dancers often use two bars of music for one bar of dance.\n\nThe musicians help the dancers by playing one musical bar strong and the second musical bar weaker. That way dancers know when their “1” starts and when they should start dancing.\n\nAgain if you paid attention, just how much a note is stressed is described by its position. For example, 1 and 5 are both the first note of a musical bar. So both should be strongly emphasized. However, 5 should be emphasized a little bit less. Thus, we can differentiate 1 and 5.\n\nThe first musical bar often sets a theme that the second bar repeats but in a milder form. With a bit of humor, I make myself the example that on the first bar, the singer belts: “I love you so much!!!!” On the second bar, he quietly adds: “But I love your little sister as well.”\n\n\nTIPS FOR FINDING THE 1---\nMost people can most of the time pick out what is 1 or 5. It’s simply the loudest song. (Emphasis in music doesn’t have to be loudest. It can be the highest pitch, the longest-held note, and all kinds of other effects that can create emphasis for the first note). Once you have a possible suspect for 1 and 5, you simply have to wait until the next musical bar starts. Is the next bar more intense or less intense? If it’s less intense, then your first guess was correct. If it’s more intense, you now have encountered the 1.\n\nDeveloping the musical ear requires actively (not passively in the background listening to music). You’ll develop a sense of the beat in the music. You’ll recognize which sounds are emphasized as the 1 or which sounds are merely syncopation and decorations. You’ll develop a feel for which is the first bar that sets a theme and which bar repeats the theme.\n\nThere are some shortcuts on how to find the 1. Music is the interchange of tension and release. Music is either creating tension or releasing tension. The 1 is so strong that it creates tension. To make it stand out, we want to release tension beforehand. So on 6, you can often here a “ding-ding” that releases the tension. If you hear such a thing, you know that in two notes, the 1 will start.\n\n\nEXERCISES FOR FINDING THE 1---\n- Listen to bachata music to pay attention to the 1 and the 5. Use active listening with your hand. Make a chopping motion with each beat. When you encounter 1 make a very drastic chopping motion. When you encounter 5, make a strong chopping motion.\n\n- Listen to bachata music. Find the 1. When you’ve found it skip to a random part in the song and try to find it again. Keep repeating.",

(The follower has to mirror the leader and starts to the right.)\n4. Focus on the chest connection. The chest of the leader should lead in the direction of each step. The follower’s chest should stay squarely and precisely in front of the leader’s chest.\n\n\nHAND POSITION:---\nBachata has many hand positions. Each position serves a particular function. The hand position that we are learning in this lesson says: “Relax! We are not going to do anything but the basic.”\n\nThe follower has her hands in front of her throat. The hands point up like tent walls that have been pulled apart to have a few inches of space in between.\n\nThe leader places his hands over the back of her hands. The leader’s base of palm and fingertips slightly press her palm together to hold onto. Key for the leader is to keep his thumb on the side of her palm, not inside. (Placing the palm inside of her palm resembles how a baby holds onto a parent's thumb. We are not looking for that aesthetic.)\n\n\nMOTIVATION:\nThis exercise is where student’s practice tends to fall apart, yet they think they are doing awesome because they are finally in a partnered position. Obviously, it’s fun to dance with a partner. However, you want to look at your first steps as a ground zero with a significant climb ahead of you.\n\nMany students tend to not step on the music. They lose all the movement technique to step awkwardly again. They step completely disconnected from their partner. Some students fall into weird habits where they try to shake their body like on a disco dancefloor. This is natural because attending to all those things is absolute information overload.\n\nOne way to deal with information overload is to isolate one thing at a time like the previous lessons focused individually on shoulder movements, developing a musical ear, and so on. Now that you’ve danced a song with a partner, you might want to go back and practice the movement on your own in the evening. Or if you have a partner, why not put on some earphones while waiting on the subway and practice some chest isolations together?\n\n\nPERSPECTIVE:\nA lot of beginners are drawn to learning dramatic figures because there is a wow factor to seeing them exquisitely executed by dancers with many years of training. Yet when they do it, they struggle to do it or it won’t look anything like the Instagram example at all because they lack the movement and leading technique underneath it (which is not obvious from watching a demo).\n\nA better goal (which beginners typically don’t know that it exists) is to focus on the quality of movement and musicality. With what you have learned so far, you could spend a year or more really happily dancing. The key is to focus on the music. Every song is unique and packed with emotion. If you sync up your movement with the song and open up your emotions to the song, every song can be deeply enjoyable and unique even if you keep the same three steps and a tap pattern. The fun is not in three steps and a tap (as some students think the step pattern is the secret to dancing). It’s in how much energy you put into each step, how you let the energy in the music drive or soothe your body, and how you hit the instruments in the music as if your body were triggering them. There is a tremendous high when you move in complete sync with your partner. Your breathing synchronizes. And you don’t need any advanced figures to access it. And learning advanced figures is not going to help you access it.\n\n\nCOMMON PROBLEMS:---\n- NOISY HAND MOVEMENTS: A lot of beginners get bored and feel like they need to add more. So they start moving their hands in circles. This is discouraged. Hand movements are signals to the follower. For example, raising the hand is often a signal for a turn. If the leader’s hands are really noisy, it’s hard for the follower to tell what’s actually meant to be a signal for her to do something.\n\n- NOT TAPPING: Some people feel uncomfortable about the tap on 4 and 8. It’s something that they may feel unfamiliar with and thus awkward. However, it’s important to keep the time. It’s part of the dance. It also marks for the follower the end of a bar so that she knows where the count is.\n\n- GETTING BORED: People who may be less connected to their bodies and music may feel like they are getting bored of three steps and a tap. They also tend to have poor body movements. Feeling and being in their bodies may be unfamiliar to them. And if you dance only doing the step without body movement and ignoring the music, it indeed can become mechanical. The solution is not to go for more complicated steps, but to learn more about body movement and music. For example, standing and only doing shoulder side-to-side isolations requires a lot of movement skill. Students often song after song struggle to keep their shoulders parallel to the ground. Once the movement starts working out, one can play a lot with the timing of the music. This exercise can develop a lot more sensibility to movement and the music to open up a new world for people who get bored to come back to the basic to discover that there is a lot more.",

              "synopsis": "A preparatory exercise that speeds up learning the basic step patterns.",
              "instructions": "(Prerequisites: This lesson requires masking tape and a smooth floor.)\n\n1. Use four strips of masking tape to create a box on the floor. The box should be large enough to fit both your feet and small enough to make it easy to step outside of it.\n\n2. REGULAR BASIC: Start by standing to the right of your box. Step into the box with both feet. Then step out of the box on the left. Keep your right knee raced high. Repeat going into the box. Keep repeating going into the box from both sides. You want to start slowly and smoothly and work up to go as fast as you can. The goal is to arrive at a point where you are simply focused on the box and your feet move in rapid-fire automatic fashion. Mentally, you want to create a sound like “tsh - tsh - tsh - tshuk” that gives you a kind of rhythm to focus on. Each time you have a knee raised, you want to pause a little bit.\n\n3. FORWARD/BACKWARD BASIC: Start by standing behind your box. Have your left knee raised. Step into the box with both feet. Step in front of the box with the right knee raised. Repeat going back and forth.\n\n4. LATERAL BASIC: Start by standing inside the box. Step out with the left leg. Push off to step back into the box and raise the right knee to prepare to go the other side. Keep repeating: Pushing off outside the box and then preparing your knee high on the other side to repeat.\n\n5. BOX STEP/QUADRATO: Start on the back right corner of the box with your left knee raised. Step onto the back left corner. Put your feet together. Step forward with your left foot to the front left corner. Keep the right knee raised to prepare. Continue around the box in the same fashion.\n\n\nMOTIVATION---\nMany people seem to lose the ability to walk normally as soon as they are in a dance class. There is a neurological explanation for it. When people consciously think of moving body parts, they use the prefrontal cortex of the brain. The prefrontal cortex is where the consciousness is. It’s really good at solving complex and intellectual problems. However, it’s very limited in how many things it can keep in focus. Thus, it’s very poor at coordinating many body parts at the same time.\n\nThe motor cortex however is excellent at coordinating every part of the body in complex movements. The motor cortex does this by creating “motor programs,” which we develop over many years. For example, our motor program for walking or sitting down has to coordinate every body part. Walking requires a swing of the arms, a tilt of the hip, etc. And it took us years to develop these motor programs. Fast learning of movement comes from reusing the existing motor programs and putting them into a new context.\n\nChoosing between activating the prefrontal cortex and the motor cortex is done by the type of cues and mental focus that we use. Using cues that direct individual body parts makes us use our prefrontal cortex. However, when we focus externally on the box (or use imagery), our prefrontal cortex holds the external focus and the motor cortex is allowed to work out which body parts have to move and how to achieve it. Over two hundred studies have confirmed that athletes perform better and learn faster with external focus (even if they marked on the pre-experiment questionnaire that they prefer an internal focus).\n\nThe exercise with the taped box may appear simple or unrelated to bachata. And that’s a good thing if it’s simple and easy to pick up the movements. I’ve observed that students who learn the traditional way tend to struggle to remember with which foot to step, have difficulty with timing, and start stepping in bizarre ways. Students learning the taped box exercise first tend to effortlessly pickup and basic steps in minutes.\n\n\nOPTION---\nThis exercise comes from agility training with ladders. You may practice the actual bachata steps right after doing the box version to transfer the learned movement to bachata. To avoid repeating the instruction, the bachata version for each step is in its own mini-lesson.",

Repeat a few times going faster each time.\n10. Put on a slow song and repeat to the song.\n\n\nMOTIVATION---\nThe basic in place is one of the common basics. It tends to be tricky for students because there is no movement and they get lost on which foot to step one. If students develop a clear mechanic to always transfer their weight right away and fully on each step, it becomes easier.\n\n\nHOW TO TAP PROPERLY---\nMany students seemingly refuse to tap for inexplicable reasons and do all kinds of other things or nothing at all. A tapped foot has no weight on it. Thus, it is free to step on the next beat. The tapped foot is right next to the weighted foot. The balls of the tapped foot are in the middle of the weighted foot.\n\n\nTIP---\nStudents often get confused on which foot to step next with. This can easily be prevented by focusing on putting the complete weight on each foot that steps right away. That way, there is always one foot that has weight and one foot that doesn’t. The foot that has no weight is logically the next foot to step with.\n\nQuite a few students step very messily. There is no telling between when their feet are apart and together. There is no telling between which foot should have weight and which one shouldn’t. Perhaps, they are afraid of making a mistake and hedge their bets by doing something halfway in between. However, it becomes really confusing for them on what to do next. Plus, if a follower were to try to follow them, it’s very confusing to what’s going on.\n\nStep clearly on when the feet are together and apart. Put the weight on one foot. Everything will become easier.\n\n\nSTYLING---\nOf course, it goes without saying that you want to do all the basics of this level with the body movement technique of the previous level: hip movements, keep the shoulders at the same level, etc.\n\nAdditionally, there is specific styling for the basic in place. Once you have the step pattern down and applied the basic body movement technique, you can add the following. As you travel to the left, you want to slightly turn your body to the left. (Many students take that as turning a full 90 degrees. However, it’s only meant to add a little flavor - like 20-30 degrees - not be an actual turn!)\n\nAlso for most of the basic, the knees are typically bent to allow more hip movement. However, on the tap on each side, it’s a nice styling attribute to raise up a bit. (Sometimes, it makes sense to lower a bit more down on the tap. For example, when the music has a heavy drop on the 4 and 8, a physical drop might make more sense than rising up.)",

Repeat a few times, getting faster each time.\n10. Put on a slow song and repeat.\n\n\nSTEPPING TOGETHER OR PASSING---\nThe forward/backward basic is often taught in two variations. Some instructors teach that the middle step should be the feet stepping next to each other. The reasoning is that (almost) all basic steps have the pattern of stepping the feet together on 2. Other instructors teach that the feet should be traveling past each other like a natural walk. Their reasoning is that it’s more important for the chest to smoothly travel forward, which is easier that way. (They try to avoid a move-stop-move pattern that stepping together might create.) While some argue, some suggest that it’s a styling choice.\n\n\nSTYLING---\nOne way to do the forward/backward basic is to move with square shoulders. A common styling option is to lead with the right shoulder in the direction of travel (e.g. the right shoulder is forward when stepping forward. Thus the body is tilted to the left.).\n\nAnother common styling option is to replace the step on the side on 4 with crossing the right foot behind the left and tapping the tip of the toes on the floor.",

Shift your weight back onto the right leg. (Students often forget to count this because there is no step and simply a weight shift.\n3. Step the left leg back to the right leg.\n4. Tap wit the right foot.\n5-8. Repeat on the other side.\n9. Repeat starting slowly and getting faster each time.\n10. Put on a slow song and repeat.\n\n\nTECHNIQUE---\nThe outward step is often done poorly by students. They don’t put weight on it. They simply flare the foot out quickly. So many teachers say to make the outward step a full step. That goes into the right direction.\n\nHowever, Korke teaches that the upper body shouldn’t travel with the foot outwards. I think of it like faking a step in basketball. You try to make your opponent believe that you are going in one direction by fully stepping there. However, as your foot lands, you are prepared to bounce back in the other direction. So you get your full weight on the foot not because your body is over the foot but from a combination of the bounce back and the body partially having traveled to that side. Stylistically, the bounce back allows you to to a full weight transfer and it allows you to do a nice hip swing in the direction.\n\n(Note: A bounce back doesn’t mean speeding up and doing a “blitz” movement like in basketball. You have to carefully time your body to stay with the speed of the music but still bounce back.)\n\n\nVARIATIONS---\nThe lateral basic has a number of variations that are fun and valuable to practice. You can easily spend a lot of time working on this.\n\n- CROSSING IN FRONT/BEHIND: The 3 and 7 step that usually brings out outside foot back to the other foot can do a number of interesting alternatives. One alternative is on 3 or 7 to step in front of the other foot. The same is possible by stepping behind.\n\n- CROSS IN FRONT - HEEL TO TOE: A variation of crossing in front is to cross in front 3 but to only place the left heel down. Then on 4, step the whole left foot flat and skip the tap. Repeat similarly on 7.\n\n- CROSS IN FRONT - CHA-CHA: Another variation is to cross in front on 3. Shift the weight back on the right foot on “and.” Shift the weight back on the left foot on 4. (Skip the tap.) The “and” count is something that we’ll get into later when learning about musicality and syncopations. The “and” count is half a beat. It’s the measure between two beats.",

Step your left foot to the right foot.\n7. Step back with the right foot.\n8. Tap with the left foot.\n9. Repeat starting slowly and getting faster each time.\n10. Put on a slow song and repeat.\n\n\nVARIATIONS---\n(The above version is the most common version and the first version taught. The following versions are less common. Some of them may not be seen at all in certain circles.)\n\n - START ON 1 OR 5: The box step can be started on 1 or 5. If you start on 5, everything is mirrored. (E.g. the first step is to the right.)\n\n- START TO THE SIDE OR FORWARD: Instead of starting to the side, one can also start forward. Accordingly, the steps are changed, but the pattern of step - together - step - tap remains the same.\n\n- SLIDE: Stepping to the side on 1 remains the same. The step on 2 however becomes a compound slide. Within one beat, the right foot slides to meet the left foot and shoots forward to land where the forward step would land. On 3, the left foot steps to meet the right. On 4, there is a tap. The step repeats similarly on the other side with a slide.\n\n- ELONGATED OR ENERGETIC BOX: The box starts as usual on 1. On 2, the above-described slide happens. The difference is on 3. On 3, the left foot doesn’t step to the right foot but steps forward. On 4, the right foot has to move forward to meet the left for the tap. This pattern looks more like an L than a square box.\n\n\nSTYLING---\n- CROSS BEHIND: Almost as common as doing the plain box is to step the right foot behind the left foot on 2. It creates a nice tilt to the right on the body. (Note that this is a tilt not a full-on turn.)\n\n- CROSS IN FRONT: Similarly, on 6, the left foot can cross in front of the right foot.\n\n- CHA-CHA: When stepping forward and backward, a cha-cha can be inserted. This would be two syncopated steps: 1 - 2 - and - 3 - and - tap. A level later will teach musicality and syncopations. This is listed here for completeness.",

              "instructions": "(The key to understanding this step is that all basics until this one have been either going side-to-side or back-and-forth. However, this step travels in a diagonal direction: back-left to front-right.)\n\n0. Start with your weight on the right leg and the left foot tapped.\n1. Step the left foot back and to the left. Swivel your knees to the front-left corner of the room.\n2. Shift your weight back to the right foot. (Not step!) Swivel your knees to the front-right corner of the room.\n3. Step the left foot across the right foot and travel forward and to the right.\n4. Tap your left foot and face your knees to the front.\n5. Step your right foot forward and to the right. Swivel the knees to the front-left corner of the room.\n6. Shift your weight back to the left foot. (No step!) Swivel your knees to the front-right corner of the room.\n7. Step the right foot behind the left foot to travel to your starting point.\n8. Tap your left foot. Straighten your knees out to the front.\n9. Repeat starting slowly and getting faster each time.\n10. Put on a slow song and repeat.\n\n\nSWIVELING PATTERN---\nStudents tend to get confused about the swiveling pattern because there are so many steps in different directions and swivels going on. Here is a mental organizing pattern that’ll make it easy to remember what to do.\n\nAll the swivels are alternating. So you know if you swiveled one way recently, you are going to swivel the next way soon.\n\nThe trick then becomes remembering which way to swivel first to get started right. That’s pretty easy to remember with a little logic. Do the the first opening step. Try swiveling to the left. You’ll notice your knees crossing as if you have to pee badly. This is obviously not the right way. Swiveling your knees to the left feels a lot easier.\n\n\nCHEST TURN OR NOT---\nSome teachers teach that the chest should always face forward. The knees/hips should disassociate for the swivels.\n\nOther teachers suggest that the above is done as an “over-correction.” Students tend to completely turn to the side, which is wrong. So telling them to face forward is an easy way to fix that problem. However, these other teachers suggest that the chest should somewhat turn because otherwise, the follower wouldn’t have any signal to do the swivels herself. Thus, the proper amount of turning is enough so that the lead transmits to the follower, but not so much as to disconnect from the follower and face somewhere else.\n\n\nNAMING---\nMadrid step is a common name for this pattern. I’ve heard second hand that Daniel y Desire do not like the name because it wasn’t the original name and the step originated nowhere near Madrid. Korke calls this step \"Diagonales\" because he likes to emphasize that the main aspect is that the step is diagonal. And any variation that’s diagonal falls under this pattern.\n\n\nVARIATIONS---\n- HIP SWING INSTEAD OF SWIVELS: A variation is to do big traditional hip swings instead of swivels.\n\n- SLIDES: Another variation is to skip the tap and to slide through. The 3 and 7 step become elongated to consume the count of the tap.\n\n- HEAD TURN: Not so much for shines but when partner dancing, leading the follower to look over her right shoulder when she steps back and to her left is a frequent and fun touch.\n\n\nUSEFULNESS FOR FIGURES---\nYou might want to take particular note of the Madrid step to use it as a prep for partnered dancing. Because the step has a turning momentum in it, it lends itself nicely as a prep for various figures. For example, it can provide the initial momentum for a head roll. Often only half of the Madrid step is used to prep into something else.",

(See below for how to flare.)\n5. Cross your right foot behind your left foot.\n6. Step your left foot to the side.\n7. Cross your right foot in front of your left foot.\n8. Flare the left foot out.\n\nNote: Angle your chest with the direction changes as you would for the Madrid step.\n\n\nHOW TO FLARE---\nThis pattern doesn’t tap but flare. A flare is also unweighted like a tap. However, instead of being next to the other foot, the flared foot is shot out to the side with a straight leg. The flared should be pointed.\n\nMany students initially struggle with how much the flared leg should be rotated. You don’t want to rotate it out so that the sole of your shoe shows. You don’t want to rotate it in so that the leg looks awkward and pigeon-toed. There is a pretty degree of rotation where the leg is nicely elongated and the “pretty” part shows to the audience.\n\n\nHOW TO EXIT---\nBecause this basic flares instead of taps, it’s a little tricky to exit the pattern. The rule is that if you want to continue doing grapevines, flare on 8. If you want to exit the grapevines, tap on 8.\n\n\nVARIATIONS---\nThe most typical crossing pattern is to do front, back, back, and front. However, you can switch up the front and back or to only do front however you want. Mathematically, there are 16 possible versions.\n\n\nUSEFULNESS FOR FIGURES---\nThe grapevine is perhaps the least likely basic pattern that a dance partner at a social knows. As such, it doesn’t happen often. However, it can provide a very eye-catching and performance-like way to travel together over distance.",

Step forward right.\n3. Step back left.\n4. Tap right.\n5. Step back right.\n6. Step back left.\n7. Step forward right.\n8. Tap left.\n\n\nOPEN BREAK WITH A 90-DEGREE TURN---\nA way to dress up the open break is to add a 90-degree turn.\n\n1. Step forward left.\n2. Shift the weight back to the right.\n3. As the left foot travels back, travel past the right foot so that the left foot induces a turn to the left by 90 degrees.\n4. When the left foot taps, rotate the foot to face to the left.\n5. Step backward with the right foot.\n6. Shift the weight back to the left and turn the left foot to face forward.\n7. Step the right foot back to meet the left foot in the starting position.\n8. Tap on the left.\n\n\nUSEFULNESS FOR FIGURES---\nThe open break is a bread-and-butter step that you’ll frequently use for partner figures. It’s the most common way to initiate entering shadow position. Doing the shuffle step is a way to dress up these common patterns with something a bit more challenging and uncommon.",

              "synopsis": "The first of many hand connections.",
              "instructions": "1. Find the push-n-pull grip with a partner. (See below)\n2. Do the weight exercise with a partner. (See below)\n3. Do the walking exercise with a partner. (See below)\n\n\nPUSH’N’PULL GRIP---\nThe leader presents his hands a little above the hip level. The palms are facing forward. The hand is angled out so that the top of the index finger and the inside edge of the palm provide a horizontal surface.\n\nThe follower places her hands over the above horizontal surface. Her wrist breaks so that both of the palms are pressing against each other. For both partners, it’s important to connect the base of the palms. Otherwise, the lead signals will transmit delayed or not at all! To achieve this, it might require rotating the hands a bit more out.\n\nThe amount of space between the body and elbow should avoid either extreme: The elbows shouldn’t be on the body. The elbows shouldn’t be high like for ballroom dancing. There should be comfortable space but also comfortable to hold for a long time.\n\nThe angle of the forearm tends to also cause problems for students. There is no simplistic recipe. To get the right angle, consider the purpose. The purpose is for the leader to control the follower’s hips. That the leader’s forearms should be angled towards her hips. (There is a variation where the leader’s forearms are angled towards her shoulder. As you’d expect that variation is done to control her shoulders.)\n\n\nCOMMON PROBLEMS---\n- CONNECT AT THE BASE OF THE PALM - NO TENTING! Virtually every beginner will leave space at the base of the palms so that the follower and leader create a tent. If the leader were to step forward, the space would have to fill first before the follower receives the momentum. Thus, she would be late. It’s not simply style but a critical function that the heels of the palm are connected.\n\n- NO GRIPPING! A lot of students will grip the other person’s hand. This is not only unnecessary but can also become pretty uncomfortable as the other person’s hand is squeezed too hard. It’s possible and completely fine to use this grip with the fingers completely open. Both partners should be providing pressure against each other. And if the leader wants to lead the follower’s hand forward, he simply needs to pull back and the follower should maintain the pressure.\n\n- SPAGHETTI ARMS! A lot of students will have soft arms. So if a leader moves forward, the follower absorb all the momentum with her arms and stays in place. You want to imagine that you have a broom stick stuck between your elbows and belly. Thus if the leader were to push on your hands, the hand pressure directly translates to your torso moving back.\n\n- LEADING WITH THE HANDS INSTEAD OF THE FRAME! Beginning leaders often move with the arms instead of the frame. That is they want the follower to step back and push with their arms. The proper way to do it is to use the frame. With frame, we mean that the arms stay in place and move together with the torso as a unit. Equally to the follower, the leader should think of having a broom stick pinned between the elbows and belly. Thus the leader cannot extend or pullback the arms. One reason for this is that the arms have very little weight. They can move very fast. The body has more weight and more inertia. Thus to move a body smoothly, you want to move it in sync with your own body to match the inertia and momentum of the follower.\n\n\nWEIGHT EXERCISE---\nStart with your partner in push’n’pull grip. Then walk your feet a few inches away from each other while maintaining the grip and arm position. This should cause both of your to lean forward at an angle. You’ll feel that you’ll fall if your partner wouldn’t push back on you. That’s the necessary feeling that the exercise goes for. If you cheat and keep your weight balanced on your own feet, you won’t be doing the exercise.\n\nOften the weight between the partners is different. You’ll notice that the lighter partner has to lean more forward to maintain an equilibrium.\n\nSlowly squat down (while maintaining the forward lean). You’ll realize that you have to negotiate with your partner to equally lean against each other or you both lose your balance. That’s the goal of this exercise: Learn to meet pressure with equal pressure. Maintain constant pressure as you go through movement.\n\nRepeat the squatting. Increase the challenge level by stepping farther away from each other to increase the dependence and pressure that you have to negotiate.\n\n\nWALKING EXERCISE---\nStart with your partner in push’n’pull grip. The leader decides a random moment to either step forward or backward. If the leader maintains the frame and the follower has no spaghetti arms, the leader and follower should move together in sync. Also tenting at the palms can cause issues.\n\nThe leader keeps switching between moving forward, backward, paushing, and changing the speed. The leader and follower learn to maintain their frame and constant pressure on the hand connection.",

              "instructions": "The bolero is somewhat difficult to practice in isolation. For this lesson, you’ll try it out with a partner to the best of your ability. We’ll discuss what it is. And in the next lessons, you’ll get to actually practice it in the context of dancing.\n\n\nWHAT IT IS---\nThe bolero is a lead signal to the follower that something different is about to happen. Most easily, it is described as a deep inhale and rising up. Imagine that you stand in front of your boss’s office and are about to read him/her the riot act. You may take a moment to work up the courage. But when you are ready, you might take a deep inhale, rise up, and then launch forward to burst through his/her door. Energetically, that’s what you are looking for.\n\nBachata is most of the time danced with bend knees. So rising up to straight legs should be noticable as well as raising the chest with the inhale. You don’t want to go up on your tippy toes or raise your shoulders.\n\n\nWHEN TO USE IT---\nBy default, both partners dance the regular bachata side-to-side. There is no signal needed for that to repeat until the song ends. However, if we want to switch to the forward basic, we need to give the follower a heads-up. So as we draw the left foot to meet the right foot for the tap on 8, we’d do a bolero. The follower will notice that something is up and be prepared to watch out for the next lead signal on what to do.\n\nSimilarly, if we want to enter the box step, we’d do a bolero as we arrive on 2. (It wouldn’t make sense to signal the box step on 1 because we start like a regular basic. Only when we diverge from the regular basic for the follower to step back do we need to signal with a bolero.)\n\n\nHOW TO BE CLEAR OR HOW TO BE LOUD WITHOUT BEING LOUD---\nThis is a discussion of an important aspect of leading. Students will often try to make the bolero noticeable by standing on their tippy toes or raising their shoulders. That’s not desirable, but how does one make the bolero clear?\n\nLike a lot of lead signals, their success depends not on the signal itself but the context. If you have a very quiet lead, every signal will stand out clearly even if it is pretty small. What is a quiet lead? Remember how the regular basic was introduced and swinging the arms was discouraged? A lot of movements, especially random movements, created noise. If your body is still and you maintain the same chest level consistently, your follower will pick up any changes clearly. So the answer is not in making the signal louder but eliminating all the noise that the other movements create.\n\nA finer topic to talk about is that there is a difference between no movement and consistent movement. Quiet as in no movement is one way to make a signal stand out. The other is to create movement patterns. Imagine that you are tapping your pen at a very consistent pace for a while. If you then make a small extra tap, people will notice. The more consistent and precise your movement patterns are, the more consistent and precise any derivation stands out.\n\nIf you are wondering how to be quiet and consistent? Look back at the movement technique lessons. Often beginner students try to rush past them to do “cool” things. Yet once they try the cool things and they don’t work so well, they get an appreciation from it for working on the basic movement technique. This focus on movement technique tends to only increase as dancers advance.",

The leader will also learn to develop choreographies on the spot.\n\n\nTo progress this exercise, start with doing a regular basic and then one other basic. The regular basic in between provides the mind a little break to recover focus and prepare for the next basic. Once that works well, go from one type of basic to the next. After that, do half a basic of one kind and then half a basic of another kind. Say do the first four counts as the box step but finish the last four counts with a basic in place.",

              "instructions": "(These are successive drills to develop your turns. Spend as much time as you want on each drill and keep going back to it.)\n\n1. Assume the starting position: Stand on one leg. Point the other leg out to the side as far as naturally goes. Raise your arms so that they move a ninety degree angle. Move your arms as far away as possible from your standing leg.\n\n2. Do ninety-degree turns: Accelerate your arms horizontally towards your standing leg. Suddenly, arrest the arm movement. This should transmit the movement to your whole body and induce a spin. The goal of the drill is to dose your momentum to create ninety-degree turns as precisely as possible.\n\n3. Control momentum with the leg: The progression of the exercise takes advantage of a physics principle. Mass far away from the center of rotation creates more inertia than mass close. As you spin, tug your free foot close to your standing foot. The heels should be touching. As you stop, should your free foot back out. You should feel your momentum accelerating as you move the free foot in and slowing as you move the free foot back out.\n\n4. Repeat with 180-degree turns: Progress the drill from ninety-degree to 180 degrees. This will require you to generate more momentum. It will also require more precision to land it exactly.\n\n5. Repeat with 360-degree turns: Progress the drill to 360-degree turns. This should be a significant challenge to land them precisely without wobble. Expect to spend days practicing this skill.\n\n6. Repeat with spotting: Spotting is a technique the prevents getting dizzy while turning. You will pick a spot on the wall in front of your at eye level. As your body turns, you’ll keep your face towards the spot. When you reach the end of your ability to rotate your neck, you’ll keep your eyes facing the spot. When your eyes are all the way in the corner and your neck is all the way turned, your body will likely be close to 180 degrees opposite to your start. At this point, snap your head around as quickly as possible to look at the spot from the other corner of your eye. As your body catches up to where your face faces, you’ll neck rotation will unwind and the eyes will look straight ahead.\n\n7. Go through the previous progressions using the other leg and turning the other way. (There are four possible combinations to turn!)\n\n8. Now that you have some experience turning your body, we have to transform the turn where we don’t use the arms. (Our partner would be in the way of those wide, held-out arms.) So we lower our arms. To generate momentum, we are going to rotate our hips and arrest that movement. Because the hips are much closer to the center of rotation, they have less power and require more finesse. Go through the drill steps again, using your hips instead of your arms.\n\nMotivation---\nEvery yokel can go to a wedding, raise an arm and the partner will attempt some kind of turning motion. While that yokel may derive a lot of pleasure and pride from “having completely mastered dancing,” there is a lot of technique to turning. If you want your partner to end in a useful position, the steps have to be precise and not a mangled mess with unexpected landing spot. Turns are one of the pillars of beauty in dance. There is a lot to it. This entire level is dedicated to turning. This lesson sets the foundation.\n\n\nBeing a little kit and skating on the frozen sidewalk---\nA lot of students struggle with using the arms to generate the turn momentum. They will move the arms but not suddenly arrest them. Most of us have learned the principle behind the sudden arrest as kids. Little kids like to run on a frozen sidewalk. And when the take a sudden wide stance without running, they start sliding across the ice. We use the same technique to do the turns on a dancefloor.\n\n\nTip---\nStudents come with all kinds of shoes to class. If you have proper dance shoes, you are probably doing okay. If you wear sneakers with rubber soles, they probably won’t allow you to spin. The worst part is that they’ll create a lot of stress on your knees and might lead to injury. For this drill, taking shoes off and using socks is probably going to make it easiest to spin. You might want to roll your socks down half of your foot. That way, your heel is bare and gives you some hold to avoid falling. Yet when you want to turn, you can stand on the balls of your free, which are sock covered, to have the most freedom to spin.",

Tap the right foot.\n\nNote: The turn can also be started on 5 instead of on 1. Then the steps are mirrored.\n\n\nMotivation---\nThe inside turn is the bread and butter of bachata turns. It’s the most common turn. During a song, you’ll likely do it a dozen times.\n\n\nCommon Problems---\n- GET LOST ON THE FOOTWORK: The second step tends to cause students the most problems. The first step is quite clear, but the second step confuses them because they partially turned. The solution is quite simple. Each time you step, commit the weight right away. That way, you’ll have only one foot free to moe. And that’s the next foot to use.\n\n- GET LOST ON THE TURN DIRECTION: Even though, the turn goes in the same direction with each step, some students get confused on the direction and start going the other way suddenly. The problem is that these students take each step, pause, and then think about what to do next. A cue that tends to help is to look at your watch. If it’s on your right wrist, you’ll want to always lead the turn with the watch.\n\n- SPINNING IN PLACE: Some students will spin in place and then add some steps. However, this is a traveling turn. With every step, you want to turn a bit more.\n\n- NOT TRAVELING: Some students do the steps, but they do them all in place. The steps should be space the same as doing a basic. The reason is that the partner will be doing a basic. So our bodies should travel together to the side - even though one person turns and the other person doesn’t.\n\n\nInside vs. Outside---\nAs the name inside turn suggests, there is also an outside turn. Inside refers to the space between the couple. In this turn, as we are turning in the travel of dance, we are turning inside. In the next lesson, we’ll turn to the right as we travel left. That’ll lead us to face the outside and will be the outside turn.",

It’s less common to do them on their own.\n\n\nVariations---\nAs the instructions show, quick turns can be initiated on 1 and 3. Of course, they can also be initiated on the second half of the basic (on 5 and 7 respectively). Another option is to do outside quick turns instead of inside quick turns. Quick turns can also be combined, e.g. an inside quick turn on 1 and 3.\n\n\nHow To Lead The Different Turns---\nThis is a little preview for when we get to leading turns. An obvious question is: How does one lead the different turns? How does the follower know which turn to execute. The lead for an inside versus quick turn are the same form. However, a quick turn gives the follower more momentum. Turns can be done at different speeds. A turn could even be slowed down to take eight counts. In that case, the lead would have to give very little momentum.",

              "instructions": "0. Start in the default position: The left foot is tapped, and the weight is on the right foot.\n1. First step of a regular basic.\n2. Second step of a regular basic.\n3. Third step of a regular basic.\n4. Instead of tapping, do a 180-degree turn and flare the right leg out.\n5. Complete a second 180-degree turn and step the right foot as you would do the fifth step of a regular basic.\n6-8. Complete the regular basic.\n\nVariation: The delayed turn can also be done between 8 and 1.\n\n\nUsefullness For Figures---\nA lot of figures happen between 1 and 4 as well as between 5 and 8. The noteworthy part of the delayed turn is that it happens in the gaps that these typical hotspots create. Thus, the delayed turn can easily be added in between figures.\n\nFor example, the leader leads a regular inside turn for the follower from 5 to 8. As the follower only has to tap on 8, the leader is free to do a delayed leader turn on 8 and finish on 1 for the next thing to start. This kind of leader turn is often combined with keeping a followers hand on the shoulder and doing a neck roll under the follower’s hand.\n\nRelated are also maneuvers like the mosquetero. That’s often danced where the follower does an inside turn that ends with an overrotation so that both the leader and follower look to the right. From here, the leader can lead both the follower and himself to do a kind of delayed turn.\n\nThe creativity of the delayed turn lies into using it after another figure to create something more interesting.",

The lock that we end in previously creates a good connection point.\n\n- Body waves are often taught in two ways: (1) The movement is taught slowly and explicitly by going through each phase.

However, body waves can be done on different times: slower (8 counts or faster 1 or 2 counts). Body waves can also be full body waves or only the chest wave without the hip swing. In this case, we are doing small, chest-focused body waves on 1 count.\n\nQuick turns:---\nIn contrast to the four-step turn from earlier, this is a quick turn.
